a124,0,English,pqr,"Federal investigators on Monday sifted through the wreckage of the helicopter crash that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight other people, hoping to find clues to what caused the accident that stunned the world.

 Bryant, 41, was traveling on Sunday with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other passengers and crew when the Sikorsky S-76 slammed into a rugged hillside in thick fog in Calabasas, northwest of LA. There were no survivors.

 A five-time NBA champion for his only team, the LA Lakers, and a double Olympic gold medalist, Bryant was widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players in history. He was traveling on his private helicopter from Orange County, where he lived, to his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks where his daughter was set to play.

 Jennifer Homendy, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told a press conference that investigators would remain at the site of the crash throughout the week to collect evidence.

 ?It was a pretty devastating accident scene,? she said, adding that the wreckage was strewn across about 600 feet (180 meters). ?We will be here about five days on scene to collect perishable evidence. We are not here to determine the cause of the accident. We will not determine that on scene.?

 Homendy said the aircraft did not have a black box, which was not required on that type of helicopter.

 Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters that it would ?take a while? to recover the remains of the victims because of the force of the crash and the rugged terrain. He added that given the number of people trying to access the site unlawfully, his agency has had to resort to police on horseback or all terrain vehicles to secure the area.

 ?We want to make sure everyone stays where they should be ... and keep everyone safe because the area is dangerous even in daytime because of the steepness of the terrain,? he said.

 Philippe Lesourd, a helicopter pilot and instructor who has been flying in California for 29 years, told AFP that the heavy fog likely caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. He said the pilot most probably suffered ?spatial disorientation? after losing sight of the ground upon entering the clouds.

 The fog was heavy enough on Sunday that the Los Angeles Police Department and the sheriff?s office grounded their helicopters for part of the day. Witnesses told local media the helicopter appeared to be flying very low and seemed to struggle before it slammed into a hillside.

 Apart from Bryant and his daughter Gianna, the other passengers on the flight included baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife Keri and their daughter Alyssa, who played basketball at the same club as Gianna. Christina Mauser, an assistant coach of the Mamba girls? basketball team, was also killed along with Sarah and Payton Chester, a mother and daughter.

 News of the crash reverberated across the globe and hundreds gathered at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, where Bryant wowed fans for 20 years, placing flowers, candles and messages for their fallen hero.

 ?It?s unbelievable that he is gone,? said Esmeralda Cisneros. ?Everyone feels empty. California and LA feel empty without him.?

 Tributes have also flooded in from former US presidents, pop stars and athletes from different sports, a sign of how the man known as the ?Black Mamba? had transcended basketball.

 The NBA announced that it had postponed Tuesday?s Lakers game against the Los Angeles Clipper in the wake of the tragedy.

 Bryant?s career began in 1996, straight out of high school. On top of his NBA championship wins, he helped the US squad of all-stars to Olympic titles in 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London.

 Bryant bowed out of the NBA in 2016, scoring 60 points in a fairytale farewell appearance at the Staples Center. The son of former NBA player Joe ?Jellybean? Bryant, the Lakers legend was born in Philadelphia while his father played for the 76ers.

 The elder Bryant played from 1984 to 1991 in Italy, giving young Kobe a global worldview as he grew up dreaming of following his dad into the NBA. He would eventually join the ranks of professionals at the age of 17, jumping directly into the NBA, only the sixth player to make such a leap.

 At 18, Bryant became, at the time, the youngest player or starter in an NBA game and the youngest winner of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. With Bryant alongside Shaquille O?Neal, the Lakers captured three straight NBA crowns from 2000-2002, returning the team to glory days unseen since 1988.

 Bryant?s career was almost derailed in 2003 when he was arrested in Colorado over a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee where Bryant was staying ahead of knee surgery. He admitted to adultery but denied an accusation of rape and the case was dropped in 2004 after the accuser refused to testify. A separate civil suit was settled under terms kept private.

 After his playing career, Bryant branched out into the entertainment industry. In 2018, he won an Oscar for his animated short film ?Dear Basketball?, a love letter to the sport which brought him fame and fortune. The film was made available online for free on Monday.

a125,0,English,abc,"US aerospace giant Boeing has identified India as one of its top markets and critical to its international growth plans, eyeing the countrys plans to buy fighter jets worth billions of dollars.

 The statement of Dennis Swanson, vice president, International Sales, Boeing Global Sales and Marketing came ahead of his visit to Indias mega defence exhibition to be held in Lucknow from February 5-9.

 In April, the Indian Air Force issued an initial tender to acquire 114 jets at a cost of around USD 18 billion, billed as one of the worlds biggest military procurement in recent years.

 The top contenders for the deal include Lockheeds F-21, Boeings F/A-18, Dassault Aviations Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Russian aircraft Mig 35 and Saabs Gripen.

 India is one of the top markets for Boeing and critical to our international growth plans. As one of the fastest growing economies in the world, India offers growth and productivity opportunities, as well as talent and technology innovation advantages, Swanson told PTI on Monday.

 Boeing has established a growing defence installation base, invested in manufacturing, skill development and engineering in India, and contributed to developing the aerospace and defence ecosystem that is being built on technology advancement and innovation, said Swanson, who is co-leading a high-powered delegation of US India Business Council to DefExpo 2020 along with David Sutton, director for the Indo-Pacific, Lockheed Martin International.

 Over 1,000 companies from nearly 70 countries will take part in the biggest-ever DefExpo to be held in Lucknow from February 5-9, according to a Defence Ministry statement in New Delhi.

 Responding to a question on Indias multi-billion fighter jet acquisition deal, Swanson said that Boeings F/A-18 Super Hornet is the latest Block III configuration that offers India the latest technologies and capabilities.

 Our F/A-18 Super Hornet Block III offers the Indian Navy a unique and differentiated capability in the form of an advanced, combat proven, multi-role naval fighter that is fully compatible with the Indian Navy carriers and would boost the growing maritime and defence relationship between the US and India, he said.

 Designed as a carrier-based fighter for high-loading, high stress operations with minimal support equipment required, the Super Hornet Block III is fully compliant with and ideally suited for the Indian Navys carrier deck, and as demonstrated in flight trials, it can take off from Indian aircraft carriers via ski jump. It is also compatible with air refuelling tankers operated around the world, Swanson said.

 Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in December visited Naval Air Station Oceana on the invitation of the US government and toured the F/A-18 squadron and sat in an aircraft.

 With the Super Hornet being the frontline fighter for the US Navy, cooperation between the two navies in naval aviation can result in the sharing of upgrades and knowledge, Swanson said.

 The F/A-18 can unlock the potential of cooperation in naval aviation, with the sharing of best practices in modern naval aviation systems, carrier integration know-how, services and training and weapon systems, he said.

 In addition, the F/A-18s integration with Indian carriers would demonstrate Indias commitment as a Major Defence Partner and the Asia Pacific Reassurance Initiative, serving as an important symbol of the new relationship between the US and India, he asserted.

 Boeing, he said, has a long standing partnership with the Indian armed forces, with the C-17, Apache, Chinook and P-8I aircraft playing an important role in mission-readiness for the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy.

 With a supply chain of over 200 partners in India, and a joint venture with Tata that is manufacturing fuselages for Apache helicopters in Hyderabad, Boeing is partnering with Indian industry to grow the indigenous aerospace industry in the country, he said.

 According to Swanson, over USD 1 billion of products and services sourced from India go into the most advanced Boeing aircraft across its commercial and defence businesses.

 While we have quadrupled sourcing from India in the last five years, we are also investing in talent, training and skill development now and for the future, he said.

 Boeing currently employs 3,500 people in India, and more than 7,000 people work with its supply chain partners, he said, noting that the company overall makes an impact on more than 1,50,000 lives.

 Swanson said Boeings research and development (R&D) presence in India includes partnerships with research partners in academia, research laboratories and industry - including IITs, IISC, and the Department of Science and Technology.

 It supports aerospace research and co-development of technologies in India to address future technical challenges in aerospace.

 The US company has established a Boeing Research & Technology India (BIETC) center that conducts research in areas such as flight sciences, materials and processes, and structures and software with Indian research partners.

 BIETC in Bengaluru and Chennai growing rapidly and is expected to employ 4,000 engineers by this year, he said.

 Our engineers undertaking complex aerospace work to support diverse areas across the local and international ecosystem. They also perform engineering activities in the areas of mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering for current and future aircraft, Swanson added.

a126,0,Tamil ,pqr,"In a sensational revelation, an investigation on Monday claimed that the popular Avast antivirus, installed on nearly 435 million Windows, Mac and mobile devices globally, harvested users data via browser plugins and then sold it to third parties, including Microsoft and Google. The joint investigation by Motherboard and PCMag that relied on leaked user data and other company documents found that the sale of this data is both highly sensitive and is, in many cases, supposed to remain confidential between the company selling the data and the clients purchasing it.

 The leaked documents accessed for the investigation were from a subsidiary of the antivirus giant Avast, called Jumpshot. The Avast antivirus programme was installed on a persons computer which collected the data, and Jumpshot repackaged it into various different products which were sold to big companies.

 Potential clients include Google, Yelp, Microsoft, McKinsey, Pepsi, Sephora, Home Depot, Conde Nast, Intuit, and many others, the report claimed.

 In a statement, Avast said it has stopped providing browsing data collected by the extensions to Jumpshot. Some clients even paid millions of dollars for products that include a so-called All Clicks Feed, which can track user behaviour, clicks, and movement across websites in detail. In copies of contracts with Jumpshot clients, one marketing firm paid over $2 million for data access last year.

 Avast offers a selection of free and paid-for antivirus and security tools, in both free and in paid-for formats. According to the investigation, Avast also recorded porn site visits that are anonymized, offered the date and time the user visited the sites, as well as search terms and viewed videos in some instances.

 Multiple Avast users told Motherboard they were not aware that Avast sold browsing data, raising questions about how informed that consent is. The investigation also that Avast is still harvesting the data, but via the anti-virus software itself, rather than the browser plugins.
