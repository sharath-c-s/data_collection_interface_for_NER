1001,0,Hindi,pqr,"Federal investigators on Monday sifted through the wreckage of the helicopter crash that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight other people, hoping to find clues to what caused the accident that stunned the world.

 Bryant, 41, was traveling on Sunday with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other passengers and crew when the Sikorsky S-76 slammed into a rugged hillside in thick fog in Calabasas, northwest of LA. There were no survivors.

 A five-time NBA champion for his only team, the LA Lakers, and a double Olympic gold medalist, Bryant was widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players in history. He was traveling on his private helicopter from Orange County, where he lived, to his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks where his daughter was set to play.

 Jennifer Homendy, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told a press conference that investigators would remain at the site of the crash throughout the week to collect evidence.

 “It was a pretty devastating accident scene,” she said, adding that the wreckage was strewn across about 600 feet (180 meters). “We will be here about five days on scene to collect perishable evidence. We are not here to determine the cause of the accident. We will not determine that on scene.”

 Homendy said the aircraft did not have a black box, which was not required on that type of helicopter.

 Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters that it would “take a while” to recover the remains of the victims because of the force of the crash and the rugged terrain. He added that given the number of people trying to access the site unlawfully, his agency has had to resort to police on horseback or all terrain vehicles to secure the area.

 “We want to make sure everyone stays where they should be ... and keep everyone safe because the area is dangerous even in daytime because of the steepness of the terrain,” he said.

 Philippe Lesourd, a helicopter pilot and instructor who has been flying in California for 29 years, told AFP that the heavy fog likely caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft. He said the pilot most probably suffered “spatial disorientation” after losing sight of the ground upon entering the clouds.

 The fog was heavy enough on Sunday that the Los Angeles Police Department and the sheriff’s office grounded their helicopters for part of the day. Witnesses told local media the helicopter appeared to be flying very low and seemed to struggle before it slammed into a hillside.

 Apart from Bryant and his daughter Gianna, the other passengers on the flight included baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife Keri and their daughter Alyssa, who played basketball at the same club as Gianna. Christina Mauser, an assistant coach of the Mamba girls’ basketball team, was also killed along with Sarah and Payton Chester, a mother and daughter.

 News of the crash reverberated across the globe and hundreds gathered at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, where Bryant wowed fans for 20 years, placing flowers, candles and messages for their fallen hero.

 “It’s unbelievable that he is gone,” said Esmeralda Cisneros. “Everyone feels empty. California and LA feel empty without him.”

 Tributes have also flooded in from former US presidents, pop stars and athletes from different sports, a sign of how the man known as the “Black Mamba” had transcended basketball.

 The NBA announced that it had postponed Tuesday’s Lakers game against the Los Angeles Clipper in the wake of the tragedy.

 Bryant’s career began in 1996, straight out of high school. On top of his NBA championship wins, he helped the US squad of all-stars to Olympic titles in 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London.

 Bryant bowed out of the NBA in 2016, scoring 60 points in a fairytale farewell appearance at the Staples Center. The son of former NBA player Joe “Jellybean” Bryant, the Lakers legend was born in Philadelphia while his father played for the 76ers.

 The elder Bryant played from 1984 to 1991 in Italy, giving young Kobe a global worldview as he grew up dreaming of following his dad into the NBA. He would eventually join the ranks of professionals at the age of 17, jumping directly into the NBA, only the sixth player to make such a leap.

 At 18, Bryant became, at the time, the youngest player or starter in an NBA game and the youngest winner of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest. With Bryant alongside Shaquille O’Neal, the Lakers captured three straight NBA crowns from 2000-2002, returning the team to glory days unseen since 1988.

 Bryant’s career was almost derailed in 2003 when he was arrested in Colorado over a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee where Bryant was staying ahead of knee surgery. He admitted to adultery but denied an accusation of rape and the case was dropped in 2004 after the accuser refused to testify. A separate civil suit was settled under terms kept private.

 After his playing career, Bryant branched out into the entertainment industry. In 2018, he won an Oscar for his animated short film “Dear Basketball”, a love letter to the sport which brought him fame and fortune. The film was made available online for free on Monday.

 Growth in the individual loans was 16 percent and on a net basis was 14 percent.

 Demand for high value loans, higher ticket items is slowing down.

 HDFCs third quarter earnings showed signs of green shoot as assets under management (AUM) growth was the best in 3 quarters, while net interest margins (NIMs) remained stable.

 Sharing details of their third quarter performance, Keki Mistry, vice chairman and CEO, HDFC said, “Our individual loan approvals grew by 15 percent on a very large base and individual loan disbursements increased by 13 percent, so  in line with what one would have expected.

 With regards to AUM, he said growth in the individual loans was 16 percent and on a net basis, it was 14 percent. Non-performing loans (NPLs) were marginally up at 1.36 percent in December quarter compared to 1.33 percent  in September, so it was a 3 basis points (bps) increase, he stated.

 However, NIMs and spreads remained the same. NIMs in Q2 were 3.3 percent and in Q3 as well stood at 3.3 percent. Spreads at the end of Q2 were 2.26 percent and at the end of Q3 were 2.27 percent,” said Mistry.

 The only other significant feature of the loan was that the transition of Gruh into Bandhan happened during the course of this quarter because the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) approval happened now and therefore under the accounting rules, we had to mark-to-market (MTM) the Bandhan shares based on the share price, he said, adding that they cannot reflect it at cost price, the way we were reflecting the Gruh price. So, there is a MTM gain that gets recognised over here but on that MTM gain, we have created the deferred tax liability - in future, if we have to sell it, we have to pay tax, there is a deferred tax liability that is being created,” he further stated.

 Throwing further light on loan growth, he said, “Individual loans in the affordable housing segment continue to remain good. Our focus on affordable housing loans continues unabated. If you look at the breakdown of the lending we have done in this quarter, and the nine-month periods, it is almost the same.

 A last-gasp header from substitute Balwant Singh saw ATK pip NorthEast United 1-0 and go atop the Indian Super League table at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan here on Monday.The hosts created plenty of chances but were wasteful until an injury-time strike from substitute Balwant proved to be the difference. Despite his absence from the touchline, Antonio Habas side returned to the top of the table, level on points with FC Goa who also have 27 points from 14 matches. The Highlanders remained on ninth position with 11 points from as many games.In-form ATK striker Roy Krishna had the NorthEast defence on red alert early on with his dangerous runs off the ball. After a couple of unsuccessful runs down the right flank, Prabir Das delivered an excellent cross in his third try and it almost found Krishnas run into the box, until Kai Heering made a crucial interception to deny the Fijian a shot on target.The visitors had their first sight of the ATK goal minutes later. Having received the ball outside the box, midfielder Lalengmawia beat his marker, entered the box but sent his effort just wide.The tempo of the game slowed down after the early attempts at both ends. ATK looked more likely to open the scoring but couldnt find a way past an organised NorthEast defence.Both goalkeepers were called into action just before the break. Edu Garcia slid a clever through-ball into the box for Krishna in the 39th minute. The ATK strikers shot from a one-on-one situation was saved by Subhasish Roy Chowdhury with his feet. At the stroke of half-time, a Ninthoinganba Meetei cross met Martin Chaves whose header from inside the box forced a fingertip save from goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya.Robert Jarni hoped to gain a foothold in the game by bringing on Jose Leudo and Federico Gallego as the teams walked out for the second half, but the hosts continued to threaten. The influential Garcia once again sent a brilliant through-ball into the box, this time for Michael Soosairaj who ran in behind the defence and attempted to poke a finish into the net. With the keeper well beaten, Mislav Komorskis goalline clearance kept the scoreline intact.Defender Pritam Kotal was next in line to be presented with another big chance to score in the 68th minute. A Javier Hernandez free-kick caused chaos inside the box and the ball looped towards Kotal whose strike flew over the bar.There were chances for both teams to settle the matter towards the end. Nikhil Kadams through ball almost sent Gallego through on goal but for Arindams quick intervention. At the other end, Mislav Komorski came up with two crucial interventions to deny Krishna and Prabir Das.Just when it looked like the teams would have to share the spoils, substitute Balwant Singh produced a match-winner in the last of the four added minutes. The striker, who came off the bench for Edu Garcia in the 90th minute and was left unmarked inside the box for a Hernandez corner-kick, headed the ball into the net to the delight of the home crowd.

1007,0,Gujarati,pqr,"What auto industry should expect from Budget 2020

 The entire country is anticipating Budget 2020, which will be presented by the government of India on 1 February. And it goes without saying that various industries have their individual set of expectations from it, but well focus on the automotive industry for obvious reasons. So, one of the most pertinent question on most citizens minds is if cars and bikes will become expensive after Union Budget 2020 is announced. And while we can never say for sure, but we can tell you that the government isnt expected to announce any policy measures that would result in cars and bikes prices in India going up.

 But the lack of any announcements that could make cars, scooters, and bikes expensive doesnt necessarily spell good news. You see, the automotive industry is still struggling with the notorious sales slowdown of 2019. And if that wasnt enough, the industry has another challenge to contend with: price hike due to BS 6. The updates necessitated due to the transition to the new emission norms has taken quite a bit of toll on vehicle prices in the country. And to help take the edge off, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) has requested the government to announce a reduction in GST for BS 6 vehicles and also bring in an incentive-based vehicle scrappage policy among other things.

 Rajan Wadhera, President of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), said, As SIAM we have urged the Finance Ministry to consider announcing an incentive based Scrappage Policy and also increase budget allocation for ICE bus procurement by state transport undertakings. Increased cost of BSVI may effect demand, hence we have also requested Government to reduce GST rates for BSVI vehicles effective 1st April from 28% to 18%.

 Both the reduction in GST and a proper vehicle scrappage policy arent new demands; nonetheless, we dont believe a reduction in GST for BS 6 cars and bikes and other vehicles is on the horizon. And as far as Indias vehicle scrappage policy is concerned -- we wouldnt get our hopes up about that one either because we havent heard about any progress in the matter ever since the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways issued draft guidelines for setting up authorized vehicle scrappage centres in India. Given that pace, we may have to wait a few more years till we get something concrete in this regard.

 A Portland father surprised his daughter by queuing up outside a store in the middle of the night so that she gets her dream wedding dress.  When Elisa Ray invited her dad for a wedding dress sale, little did she realise he would be among the first few waiting at the store.

 In order to cut down on expenses, Ray had found a wedding dress sale in which all the dresses were up for grabs for $150 dollars. Though the event was supposed to start by 7 am, the demand was so high that eager shoppers are allowed to form lines at 4 am.

 So I invited my dad to a wedding dress event where all dresses are $150. The event starts at 7am but lines can form at 4am. My Dad just called me and said he brought a chair and is the first person outside the building already waiting….. ITS 2:55AM.

 Ray said she only wanted her father to take turns in the line, but was surprised when he texted her saying he was already at the store. She also shared a video of her dad sitting comfortably in a chair holding a coffee cup.

 Take a look at the video here:

There is a possibility that cases might be reported from Gujarat.”

 Dr Rathod added that to deal with any such situation, exposure and training have been provided to most of the hospital staff along with creating an isolation ward. A health advisory has been issued to the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International Airport at Ahmedabad asking passengers for “self-reporting” in case they have visited China or South East Asian countries.

 Foldable phones are a thing now. It all started last year when Samsung and Huawei launched their respective foldable phones Galaxy Fold and Mate X at Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2019. This year’s MWC event will also likely witness the launch of several foldable smartphones.

 More and more manufacturers are working on foldable phones right now. There’s Motorola who launched the new Motorola Razr flip phone, which is heading to India very soon. The company is now said to bring a 5G version of its Razr flip phone. The existing one comes with 4G support and is powered by Snapdragon 710 processor.

 Then there’s Samsung again, who reportedly plans to launch yet another foldable phone in the upcoming Unpacked event that’s set for February 11. This one from Samsung is said to the Galaxy Z Flip which is expected to come with clamshell like design. It now appears and HMD Global — finally — is joining the competition soon with its first foldable phone.

 Here’s how much the upcoming Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip foldable phone could cost

 The latest report from Nokiamob, a website that keeps a track of new and upcoming Nokia products, now reveals that HMD Global is working on a foldable smartphone. The tipped Nokia foldable phone is already in the works and said to launch either by the end of this year or beginning of the next, 2021.

 The report doesn’t reveal any specification details about the upcoming Nokia foldable phone but does suggest that the design will be similar to Motorola Razr. In other words, expect Nokia’s foldable phone to sport a clamshell-like design. Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z flip phone is also expected to come with a clamshell like design and won’t look anything like the Galaxy Fold.

 Alongside the foldable phone, HMD Global is also working on the successor of Nokia 9 PureView. The phone is tipped to be called Nokia 9.2. Past reports had said that HMD will delay the launch of the Nokia 9.2 but a new report from Nokiamob suggests that the phone could launch sooner than expected.

 Here’s what HMD is planning for Nokia 9.2

 The Nokia 9.2 is expected to launch in the first half of this year. No specific month for the launch has been revealed for now. The same report reveals that the Nokia 9.2 will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 865 processor. This means that this Nokia phone will compete with phones like Samsung Galaxy S20, OnePlus 8, among others.

1021,0,Gujarati,pqr,"NEW DELHI: A 5-judge bench of the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Tuesday the Centre’s plea seeking Rs 7,844 crore as an additional fund from successor firms of US-based Union Carbide Corporation, now owned by Dow Chemicals, for giving compensation to victims of 1984 Bhopal Gas tragedy.

 The bench, comprising Justices Arun Mishra, Indira Banerjee, Vineet Saran, M R Shah and S Ravindra Bhat, will hear the curative petition filed by the Centre for enhanced compensation for the victims.

 The Centre is seeking a direction to Union Carbide and other firms for Rs 7,844 crore additional amount over and above the earlier settlement amount of USD 470 million in 1989 for paying compensation to the gas tragedy victims.

 Over 3,000 people had died in the tragedy due to the release of methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas.

 The Union Carbide Corporation (UCC) gave a compensation of USD 470 million (Rs 715 crore at the time of settlement) after the toxic gas leak from the Union Carbide factory on the intervening night of December 2-3, 1984 killed over 3,000 people and affected 1.02 lakh more.

 The survivors of the 1984 tragedy have been fighting for long for adequate compensation and proper medical treatment for ailments caused by the toxic leak.

 The Centre had filed the curative petition in the apex court in December 2010 for enhanced compensation.

 On June 7, 2010, a Bhopal court had convicted seven executives of Union Carbide India Limited (UCIL) to two years’ imprisonment in connection with the incident.

 Then UCC chairman, Warren Anderson was the prime accused in the case but did not appear for the trial.

 On February 1, 1992, the Bhopal CJM court had declared him an absconder.

 The courts in Bhopal had issued non-bailable warrants against Anderson twice — in 1992 and 2009.

 Anderson died in September 2014.

 The BJP leader had also alleged that the protest was emerging as “a textbook case of a few hundred people trying to suppress the silent majority”.

 “Now, the Law Minister calls the protesters at Shaheen Bagh as part of the tukde tukde gang.

 Washington DC: According to a recent study in Canada, the rate of survival of preterm babies in Canada has increased by 25 per cent after the introduction of national program - Evidence-based Practice for Improving Quality (EPIQ) in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) across the country.

 The new research was published in the journal CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal). The EPIQ program was introduced in 2003 by the Canadian Neonatal Network in 25 neonatal units to improve outcomes for premature babies.

 The study, originating from Sinai Health in Toronto, analyzed the effect of changes in care practices on outcomes for 50 831 infants born prematurely between 2004 and 2017.

 Researchers found that survival without major adverse health effects increased from 56.6 percent to 70.9 percent (25 percent) for very preterm babies and from 70.8 percent to 74.5 percent (5 percent) for babies born between 23 and 25 weeks gestation, over the course of the 14-year program.

 Preterm babies often have chronic health issues due to early premature birth, and this quality improvement program resulted in a significant reduction in several adverse outcomes for such babies.

 For example, the researchers also found that participation in the program was associated with a 15 per cent decrease in bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a chronic lung disease associated with prematurity, and a 44 per cent decrease in late-onset sepsis and other adverse conditions.

 Within the Canadian neonatal community, we have developed a system of continuously learning from each centre about how evidence-based strategies are implemented and what are the barriers and facilitators for improving quality, says Dr. Prakesh Shah, Paediatrician-in-Chief at Sinai Health and Director of the Canadian Neonatal Network.

 This learning, combined with a regular flow of data to guide our practices, has significantly improved outcomes for most vulnerable newborns.

 An international study of 10 high-income countries found that neonatal outcomes improved the most in Canada, perhaps because of the EPIQ program, which is now standard practice in Canadian NICUs. It has also been adapted to other countries.

 Our study shows that if we apply what we know in a systematic way, we can improve quality of care and outcomes over the long term for preterm babies, says Dr. Shah.

 In a related commentary, Dr. Mary Brindle, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, writes EPIQ demonstrates a rare sustained achievement...which clearly illustrates the importance of commitment to ongoing improvement in national quality-improvement programs. She contrasts EPIQ with several other initiatives that have struggled to sustain change on a large scale.

 Fuel prices in India were lowered for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday as international oil rates continued to slide over fears of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

 Petrol prices per litre were cut by 11 paise to Rs 73.60 in New Delhi, Rs 76.22 in Kolkata, Rs 79.21 in Mumbai and Rs 76.44 in Chennai. Diesel prices per litre were reduced by 13 paise to Rs 66.58 in New Delhi, Rs 68.94 in Kolkata, Rs 69.79 in Mumbai and Rs 70.33 in Chennai.

 International oil benchmark Brent crude was down by 0.3 percent to $59.17 per barrel on Tuesday. On Monday, the index had slipped to its lowest in three months to $58.50.

 Fuel prices in India are based on international oil price movements and rupees exchange rate.

 Chinese health authorities said that the coronavirus outbreak has killed 106 people and infected 4,515 raising fears across the globe. Countries, including the US, have issued warnings against travel to China, leaving millions of travellers stranded at the biggest holiday in the Chinese calendar.

 Investors in oil are concerned that travel restrictions and fall in economic growth will dampen demand for crude and its products while supply remains high.

 There are concerns that spread of infection, transportation disruptions, cancellation of group tours from China and an extension in the Lunar Holiday will likely hurt the global economy. If the situation takes longer to subside, it will hurt exports, output and corporate profits of companies that are impacted by production and consumption in China.

 Sikkim will take on Mizoram in the final match of the tournament on Tuesday.

 Sikkim has topped the group-B in the league round with 7 points to secure it berth in the semi-final round of the tournament.

 Being a very crucial match, Sikkim maintained a constant pressure on the opponent with an attacking game from the start of the match but did not find the net to score any goal.

 The first half of the match ended goalless draw.

 Sikkim continued with its attacking game again in the second half and Kintup Lachungpa finally gave the breakthrough to Sikkim with his goal in the 59th minute.

 However, Sikkim team could not able to maintain the lead for long when Tapi Hakhe scored the equalizer for Arunachal Pradesh in the 78th minute to end the full time of the match 1-1 draw.

 Even as the markets continue to remain just 2 per cent below their historic lows, there are many good quality stocks that have dived to 52-week lows. Here are a few of them:

 ONGC

 Indias largest oil and gas exploration company is trading at Rs 116.80, which is just 1 per cent away from its 52-week low of Rs 115.55.

 A fall in crude prices has pushed the stock lower. Moreover, divestment of stake sale in the company may also be an overhang on the stock. However, at these levels the stock is trading at a 1-year forward p/e of just 5 times, which is almost half of the valuations when compared to global peers.

 At the current price of Rs 116.40, the stock yields a dividend of more than 6 per cent, which is not bad at all.

 Oil India

 Oil India is another oil and gas exploration company like ONGC, which is just 1 per cent lower than its 52-week low price of Rs 137.

 Again, the stock at the current market price of Rs 138.70, gives a good dividend yield of 7.30 per cent. If both these companies increase their dividends, the dividend yield is significanly higher.

 Hindustan Zinc

 Indias largest Zinc and silver producer has seen its share price drop to Rs 200, which is just three per cent away from a 52-week low. There were hopes that the board would declare dividends at the last board meeting when quarterly numbers were declared.

 However, that did not happen. The stock would remain a good bet for its dividend yields.

 Indian oil Corporation

 This is another stock that is just 3 per cent away from its 52-week low and is currently trading at Rs 117.40. Government owned oil marketing company stocks and those from the oil exploration business have both seen their share prices drop.

 One reason for the same could be the divestment. However, most of these stocks do offer value.

 Marico

 FMCG major Marico, is a stock that is just 4 per cent away from its 52-week lows. The stock is trading at Rs 339, against its 52-week low of Rs 324. FMCG stocks have been hurt on account of the economic slowdown. Some of these stocks could be a good bets for the long-term. If some of the PSU stocks declare good dividends, they would be ideal, given that dividends are tax free in the hands of investors up to a sum of Rs 10 lakhs.

 But, Randy Orton interfered segment and teased a reunion of Rated RKO, before hitting the patented cutter on Edge and then proceeded to hit Edge with stell chairs. He then placed a steel chair on the neck of Edge (neck injury had forced Edge to retire), and took to the top rope, but contemplated his next, to build the tension, However, he climbed down, took two more chairs and proceeded to hit Edge on the head before leaving his former tag partner lying in shock.

1038,0,Tamil ,xyz,"Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting has revealed that it was his teammate Shane Warne who had given him the nickname ‘Punter.’

 “We were getting paid $40 a month when we were living at the cricket academy in 1990. I used to go to the TAB to have a bet on the dogs and Shane Warne gave me the nickname,” Ponting said in a tweet reply to a fan.

 The word punt in Australian lingo means to place a bet on horse races or dog races, usually.

 Ponting, a multiple World Cup-winning captain, is passionate about greyhound racing.

 Meanwhile, Ponting on Monday backed young Rishabh Pant, saying he is immensely talented and the stumper will be making his way back to the Indian playing XI “sooner than later”.

 Ponting, who is associated with the Delhi Capitals as mentor in the Indian Premier League (IPL), also said that he is looking forward to work with Pant in the upcoming edition of the cash-rich league.

 “Rishabh Pant is a young man with a huge amount of talent. I am looking forward to working with him again during the IPL and I am sure he will be back in the Indian team sooner rather than later,” Ponting said while replying to one of the users during his interaction with fans on Twitter.

 The Indian team management had decided to hand KL Rahul the dual role of a ‘keeper-batsman’ in limited-overs by dropping Pant from the playing XI in the ongoing T20I series against New Zealand.

1039,0,Telugu,pqr,"Ben Stokes and Mark Wood made a double strike shortly before tea, breaking stubborn South African resistance and setting up a 191-run win for England on the fourth day of the fourth and final Test at the Wanderers Stadium on Monday.

 The win clinched a 3-1 series victory for England.

 Set to make a world record 466 to win, South Africa reached 181 for two before Stokes bowled home captain Faf du Plessis for 35.

 In the next over man-of-the-match Wood dismissed Rassie van der Dussen for 98. He went on to claim four for 54 to finish with match figures of nine for 100.

 Quinton de Kock and Temba Bavuma shone briefly but South Africa were bowled out for 274.

 Van der Dussen and Du Plessis batted for all but 13 minutes of an extended two-and-a-half hour afternoon session to give South Africa some hope, making the England bowlers toil on a hot afternoon.

 But Stokes bowled a ball which hit a crack and kept low, deflecting off the toe of Du Plessis’ bat into the stumps.

 Van der Dussen looked set for a maiden Test century but in the next over he fell to Wood two short of the landmark.

 He had batted impressively, hitting 15 fours and two sixes in a 133-ball innings but both he and Du Plessis were given a torrid time by Wood, bowling at express pace on a pitch where the bounce was gradually becoming more unpredictable.

 With tea looming, England set a field which suggested a short-pitched barrage was likely. But Wood then bowled a full-length delivery which Van der Dussen drove awkwardly to short cover where Stuart Broad held a good diving catch.

 It was the second wicket for Stokes — both which came at crucial times shortly before an interval. His first victim was opening batsman Dean Elgar, who was caught and bowled playing an awkward pull shot in the penultimate over before lunch. Stokes finished with two for 47.

 De Kock and Bavuma batted brightly in a fifth-wicket stand of 48 before Broad bowled a vicious bouncer which Bavuma gloved to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.

 Broad had Dwaine Pretorius caught at fine leg in his next over and the rest followed.

 Vernon Philander, playing in his last Test, struck a couple of beefy blows before falling to Wood who supplied the coup de grace, another lifting ball flicking Anrich Nortje’s glove on its way through to Buttler down the legside.

 Lucknow, Jan 28: The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to allow bars in big cities to remain open up to 2 am and those in five-star hotels till 4 am, an hour later than earlier.

 Principal secretary Sanjay Bhoosreddy told PTI that the decision, which will come into effect on April 1, is meant for the convenience of guests, particularly foreigners.

 Licensed bars in major UP cities could earlier remain open up to 1 am, or 3 am if they are located in five-star hotels. Unlike before, hotels in small cities can also apply for a liquor licence.

 Mumbai’s eateries, malls, multiplexes to remain open 24x7 from January 27

 The Uttar Pradesh cabinet last week gave its nod to the 2020-21 excise policy under which the licence fee for selling country-made liquor was increased by 10 per cent. A licence for serving beer is up 15 per cent and for foreign liquor 20 per cent.

 The government has made a simple and transparent excise policy. Renewal of licences will be done through e-lottery. Under the new policy, one person will be allowed to have only two shops in the state, Bhoosreddy had said after the cabinet meeting. Beer shops will now be allowed to sell wine.

 A licence fee will be charged to serve liquor on luxury trains, which was free earlier.

 Licences will also be given to airport lounges and hotels located outside the airport where airline passengers stay. All liquor bottles will have barcodes so that the consumer can check for spurious liquor.

 The annual licence fee to serve liquor in 50-room hotels in the bigger cities will be Rs 10 lakh from April 1.

 Bengaluru malls, hotels to provide drinking water free of cost, it is mandatory now

 These include Gautam Buddh Nagar or Noida, Ghaziabad, Kanpur, Agra, Allahabad, Lucknow and Varanasi. The licence fee for category-2 cities has been fixed at Rs 7.50 lakh per year. These include Bareilly, Aligarh, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Mathura, Meerut, Moradabad, Saharanpur, Ayodhya and Firozabad.

 The annual fee for category-3 cities is now Rs 5 lakh and for category-4 town Rs 2.50 lakh, it was announced last week.

 Dr Thanikasalam Veni who has 25-year of vast experience in field Siddha and Ayurvedic medicines said,We have formulated a medicine from an extract of herbs. It is very effective to cure any type of viral fever. Coronavirus has no medicine.

 In Chinas Wuhan where Coronavirus has claimed over 50 lives, experts have no idea how to cure the disease. Our herbal extract medicine is used to treat dengue, multi-organ fever and acute liver fever.

 Coronavirus: Death toll climbs to 106 in China, 24 deaths in Hubei province overnight

 We want to tell the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Chinese government that our medicine is very effective in treating multi-organ failure in corona fever condition, he said.

 The Siddha doctor also claimed that the medicine formulated by him along with his team treats infections caused by the virus within 24 hours to 40 hours.

 When we treated the dengue virus with our medicine, many patients with reduced platelets count, acute liver failure, immunity deficiency and low white blood cell (WBC) were cured within 24-40 hours, said Veni.

 In coronavirus too I am confident our medicine will be very effective, he added.

 The doctor said he is willing to help the state and the central government as well as China if required.

 If the Centre and state government require then I am ready with medicine. Also, if China wants my contribution I am ready to fly immediately to Wuhan with my medicine which can cure Coronavirus, he said.

 Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Health Minister C Vijayabaskar said that the state is well prepared and is taking all precautionary and preventive steps to tackle any possible infections.

 More than 50 million people across China have been put under partial or complete lock down as the countrys government steps up its response.

 Meanwhile, a confirmed coronavirus case is yet to be discovered in India but a series of similar hospitalisations in four cities - Kolkata, Jaipur, Chandigarh and Patna - as well as the death of a Thai national in West Bengals capital on Monday, raised fears of the pathogen having arrived on Indian soil.

 Remember Shehnaaz Gill’s reaction when Himanshi Khurana had entered Bigg Boss 13 as a wild card contestant? The presence of arch-rivals under one roof did intensify the game and Shehnaaz’s crazy reactions piqued the audience’s interest in their rivalry. Although Shehnaaz did try her best to mend her ties with Himanshi in the house, the latter made sure she maintained a distance from her. But looks like months after getting evicted from Bigg Boss 13, Himanshi has changed her mind and is now planning to bury the hatchet with Shehnaaz.

 In fact, she even dropped hints after she sent birthday wishes to Shehnaaz today. Himanshi, who is quite active on social media shared a beautiful picture of herself hugging Shehnaaz from her stint on Bigg Boss 13 and wrote, “Happy birthday Shehnaaz” followed by a cute smiling emoticon. To note, the picture was clicked while Himanshi was bidding adieu to the housemates after getting eliminated from the popular reality show.

 Blunt starred opposite husband John Krasinski, who also directed the film. She was not only taken aback by how popular the film proved to be, but also how much conversation it sparked off over theories surrounding deeper themes, reports femalefirst.co.uk.

 She said: I was gobsmacked. Not only by just how many people went to see it and then told their friends to see it, and then it had this meteoric life that was not expected by me. But also the very deep metaphorical themes that people pulled out of it, some of which were intended and some of which really werent. They found it really involving and exciting.

 Now the couple is ready with a sequel of the film, although they resisted the idea initially.

 I wrote the first one to be one thing, and then when it did well and (the studio) were like, Were going to do a sequel, I thought, Great. Go find someone else. Itll be great. Enjoy it, said Krasinski.

 India will chase its first T20I series win on New Zealand soil when they take on the hosts in the third T20I of a five-match series at Hamilton. India leaned on KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer’s power-packed batting and Jasprit Bumrah’s miser bowling to beat New Zealand in the opening two T20I matches and will hope to repeat the same when both teams face-off again in the 3rd T20I match. New Zealand, on the other, will hope to halt the dry run and bounce back in the T20I series to end their home summer on high. While their bowling has certainly been off-colour, New Zealand’s batsmen have got starts but have failed to capitalise. Take a look at some mini-battles that will be at play in India vs New Zealand 3rd T20I encounter. New Zealand Vs India, Cricket Score 3rd T20I Match.

 New Zealand opening duo Martin Guptill and Colin Munro have started well but have failed to go big. Munro scored a fine half-century in the 1st T20I match but failed to bat the ball in the 2nd while Guptill has played short cameos in both the Twenty20 internationals before getting out chasing a biggie. Among the others, Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor are experienced and must shoulder New Zealand’s series fightback while Tim Seifert showed glimpses of a good finisher. Colin de Grandhomme has, however, been the biggest department for the hosts. Coming in at 4, Grandhomme has been dismissed by Ravindra Jadeja in both the innings and have failed to last more than five deliveries. Virat Kohli May Become First Batsman to Score 3000 T20I Runs, Could Achieve Feat In Ongoing IND vs NZ Series.

 In a series, where most bowlers have come under the pump Jasprit Bumrah has been a standout. His records after two T20I matches in the series reads – eight overs, two fours, one six and 52 runs conceded. This involves a game where both teams smashed over 200 runs and bowlers went over a run-rate of 8 and that’s why Bumrah has been the difference among both teams. His tight length and ability to restrict the opposition have awarded wickets to the other bowlers. Guptill, forced to contain himself against Bumrah, went big against the other bowlers and lost his wicket in both the matches. Jasprit Bumrah One of Best Death Bowlers, Says Martin Guptill After New Zealand’s 2nd T20I Defeat.

 Ravindra Jadeja dismissed Colin de Grandhomme in both the opening two T20I matches. Such has been Jadeja’s dominance over Grandhomme that the hard-hitting New Zealand all-rounder have failed to last even an over against Jadeja despite being promoted up the order in both the matches. Grandhomme though has the ability to change matches on his own and will hope to repay the management’s faith with a big innings in the 3rd ODI match. He has been out on single digits in his last four T20I matches but has hit at least a half-century in each of the last three T20I series for New Zealand.

 Iyer have run havoc in both the opening T20I matches with successive power-packed innings while Ish Sodhi have struggled to hit the right lengths and have conceded over 30 runs on both the first two matches. But in the 2nd T20I match, Sodhi showed more composure with his clever usage of the flighter and leg spinners. Sodhi even removed Iyer although that served more as a consolation than a prized scalp. With Iyer sealing his place in the Indian team and Sodhi’s place coming under the threat, this could be a mini-battle to watch out for.

 A win at Hamilton on January 29, 2020 (Wednesday) could make Virat Kohli and his team the first Indian side to clinch a T20I series win in New Zealand. India already lead the five-match T20I series 2-0 having come to New Zealand on the back of successive T20I series victories over Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. For New Zealand, it is a matter of face-saving at home before thinking of levelling the series.

1059,0,Tamil ,abc,"Los Angeles, Jan 28 (AFP) NBA superstar LeBron James said Monday he was heartbroken and devastated over the death of Kobe Bryant while vowing in an Instagram post to continue Bryants championship legacy with the Los Angeles Lakers.

 Bryant, a five-time NBA champion in 20 seasons with the Lakers, died Sunday at age 41 in a helicopter crash only hours after Lakers star James overtook him for third on the leagues all-time scoring list.

 Im heartbroken and devastated my brother, James posted. Man I love you big bro.

 I promise you Ill continue your legacy man! You mean so much to us all here especially #LakerNation and its my responsibility to put this shit on my back and keep it going!!

 Please give me the strength from the heavens above and watch over me! I got US here!

 The NBA postponed Tuesdays scheduled Lakers game against the Los Angeles Clippers in the wake of Bryants tragic death. The Lakers next scheduled game is at home Friday against Portland.

 James also made it clear he is still trying to process the shocking death of an iconic long-time rival and dear friend long before they had expected to say farewell, the crash having killed nine people in all, including Bryants daughter Gigi.

 Im Not Ready but here I go, James said to start his message.

 Man I sitting here trying to write something for this post but every time I try I begin crying again just thinking about you, niece Gigi and the friendship/bond/brotherhood we had!

 I literally just heard your voice Sunday morning before I left Philly to head back to LA. Didnt think for one bit in a million years that would be the last conversation wed have. WTF!!

 The Lakers have won 16 NBA titles in team history, one shy of the Boston Celtics all-time record. Bryant won five titles in seven NBA Finals appearances, taking crowns in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010.

 But the Lakers have suffered six consecutive losing seasons since their last playoff appearance, including the final three campaigns of Bryants career.

 This season, the Lakers have the second-best record in the NBA at 36-10 to lead the Western Conference, with James averaging 25.3 points, 7.7 rebounds and a league-best 10.7 assists a game.

 James had reached the NBA Finals eight consecutive years and nine times in his career until last years Lakers struggled in his first season with the club.

 Bryant retired in 2016, the same year James fulfilled his life dream of winning an NBA title with his hometown club, the Cleveland Cavaliers, after having taken his first two crowns with the Miami Heat.

 James led the Cavaliers into the NBA Finals the next two seasons, losing each time to Golden State, and in 2018 opted to leave Cleveland and join the Lakers. James said his heart went out to Bryants widow, Vanessa, and Kobes surviving daughters.

 Theres so much more I want to say but just cant right now because I cant get through it! James wrote. Until we meet again my brother!! Jamess message came alongside a photo of him in a Lakers uniform greeting Bryant as he rose from a courtside seat. (AFP)

 The production of onions is expected to increase by more than seven per cent this year on the back of the farmers interest in onion cultivation during the Rabi season, in the backdrop of the rising prices of the bulb that had shot up to Rs 150 per kg in the recent past.According to the first advance production estimate of the crop year 2019-20 released by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare on Monday, the country may produce 244.5 lakh tonnes of onions this year, which is 7.17 per cent more than the 228.2 lakh tonnes in 2018-19.Due to the last monsoon rains, the Kharif crop has suffered damage in major onion producing states of the country.Since September 2019, the price of onions began increasing despite all the measures taken by the government to control the prices.

 Under the new ICC rule, a player who has been concussed either while batting, bowling or on the field, can be withdrawn from the game and be replaced subject to approval by the match referee.

 The BCCI will also have an All Stars game between top international players before the start of IPL for a charitable cause.

 Ganguly also said that there will be five double headers (4 p.m. and 8 p.m.) this time.

 On the Cricket Advisory Committee (CAC), the former India captain said that it has been finalised and BCCI Secretary Jay Shah will make the official announcement soon.

1070,0,Tamil ,pqr,"I woke up at around 10 am yesterday, and following my morning routine, grabbed my phone with half-opened eyes. There were around 60 messages on the office WhatsApp group. That generally happens when a big player retires or sparks a controversy. But what I read next, left me devastated. Kobe Bryant was no more. At 41, he was dead.

 But how? He was active yesterday, congratulating Lebron James for breaking his record and becoming third on the NBAs all-time scoring list. I read further and knew he lost his life in a helicopter crash. Along Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna Bryant, who held ambitions of walking on the footprints of his father and was scheduled to play an afternoon game, was also killed, along with 7 others, when their Sikorsky S-76 helicopter crashed into a rugged hillside in Calabasas, west of Los Angeles.

 How do you react to such news? At first, we wanted to believe it was fake, but it wasnt.

 The world lost a legend yesterday. But he will live forever, in millions of hearts, and in mine.

 Kobe Bryant had extraordinary accomplishments. If you watch clips of his playing days even today, trust me, you would wonder, how the hell can he do that. He just turned the game into a circus, scoring from every corner and sometimes even from behind the board. He had five NBA championships, an NBA MVP award, 18 NBA All-Star selections, two Olympic gold medals, and even an Oscar and a best-selling novel.

 In his glittering 20-year career, Bryant inspired many around the globe to pick up a basketball, including a 14-year-old girl in a city of Rajasthan.

 I was in my 7th standard when our sports teacher took us to the schools cemented basketball court, which was until then used for morning assembly prayers, for the first time. She handed us the basketballs and for a couple of months, we learned only dribbling and passing. And in those months I realized I was actually really good at the game and I started to feel at home on the court.

 For over a year, I had no idol in basketball. It was only in the 8th grade when one of the seniors in the team, who was a big NBA fan herself, introduced me to Kobe Bryant- the Black Mamba.

 The first thing that I was told about Bryant was that he scored 81 points against the Toronto Raptors in January 2006 to register the second-highest scoring output in league history (behind Wilt Chamberlain’s 100-point game in 1962). It was maddening to even hear that.

 Let me tell you, once you get to know Kobe Bryant, you change. He inspires you to compete with the very best of your ability.

 Bryant made the direct leap from high school and in 1996, at age 18, he became the youngest player in NBA history. It was also the Olympic year (2008) when I started following him. His brilliant fourth-quarter burst and 20 points in total lead the USA team to a dramatic win over Spain for the gold medal. Kobe Bryant was so big in China that in the final the Americans had support from the locals as well, who were cheering for Bryant.

 To me, it was not about the Los Angeles Lakers, but I merely enjoyed watching Bryant score. To me, he was a magician, finding his ways to get to the net. For every time he was on the court, he would do something that would leave you mind-boggled. It would leave one reeling how he used his skills to take his taller opponent off the dribble.

 I am glad that I started following him at that time as the Lakers were unstoppable between 2008-2009 as much of that credit went to Bryant. The shooting guard scored 30 points in the playoffs to end his 7-year-wait for another championship and stepped out of the shadow of former teammate Shaquille ONeal.

 Those who followed Bryant also knew about his 46-point clinic in 2008, a 40-piece in 2000 and a 27-point, 16 rebound, nine assist gem in 2010 but, for me, it was his confidence in every game, that made him different. As a shooting guard one has to have a real understanding of the game and Bryant it was his intelligence on the court that made him the master of the game. 6-foot-6 Bryant had exceptional ballhandling skills and a knack for generating scoring chances across the court.

 I played basketball for four years in my schooling days until I had to give up on the sport to take coaching for IIT, for, of course, there were already fewer engineers in the world. In my short, mediocre sporting career, where I played state-level thrice and made the cut to the nationals once, Kobe Bryant has been the only person I looked up to, not only for his skills but also for his work ethics. I had learned about him that he used to wake up at 3 am for the gym and that inspired me to give up my morning sleep and push myself to the court.

 I lost my touch with the sport after 2010 but I remember watching him play in his in 2016 in legendary 60-point farewell game, which was also witnessed by his family, including Gianna. The Black Mamba retired with the third-highest total of points in NBA history, 33,643; his total was overtaken by James on the day before Bryant died.

 Bryant was such a mammoth figure that after his 20 seasons career Lakers retired both jersey numbers he wore over two 10-season stretches: No. 8 and No. 24.

 Now, when is no more, Kobe Bryant will also be remembered as a legend, both, on the court and off the court.

 I would paraphrase NBA coach David Fizdale here: The Lakers are the heartbeat of LA and Kobe Bryant was the blood running through it.

1071,0,Telugu,abc,"Rawalpindi: Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar reckons that the Virat Kohli-led India is swiftly becoming a ruthless team as they proved their mettle once again, this time against New Zealand in the second T20I of the series.

 Akhtar was also all praise for different members of the Men in Blue.

 After India defeated the Black Caps by seven wickets in the second affair of the five-match rubber in Auckland on Sunday, Akhtar said on his Youtube channel: India is becoming a ruthless team as they once again proved it against New Zealand in the second T20I. If you (Kiwis) are being bowled out for such a modest total, how will you compete against a side like India which possesses a long batting line-up.

 Earlier, I had said that (Colin) Munro and (Martin) Guptill would have to score big, otherwise it would be impossible to stop the onslaught of India, he added.

 Known as the Rawalpindi Express in his playing days, Akhtar also lauded pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammad Shami saying: Have seen a new confidence from Bumrah and Shami as they have now started to create fear in the oppostion batsmen. Also, Ravindra Jadeja doesnt let you score runs and bowls some odd spins which and tests the batsmen.

 The 44-year-old lamented the fact that competition in cricket is slowing down globally as teams have failed to show character and any fight.

 At present India is dominating the world one-sided. But what will happen to other teams? What will happen to world cricket? he asked.

 When Australia dominated world cricket, at least India and Pakistan showed fight and tried to compete. However, what we are seeing in New Zealand is that the hosts have completely surrendered before India in the first t20 T20Is, he added.

 India will now aim to seal what would be their first T20I series-win over New Zealand when they meet the hosts in the third match in Hamilton on Wednesday.

 Lucknow: Actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, who had joined Congress just before the Lok Sabha elections, has, once again, angered his party colleagues.

 Sinha was in Lucknow on Monday and he attended the press conference of former union minister Yashwant Sinha who is leading a Gandhi Sandesh Yatra. The press conference was held at the Samajwadi Party headquarters and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav was also present there.

 Congress leaders in Lucknow are now demanding action against Shatrughan Sinha for his continuing affinity for the Samajwadi Party.

 Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam tweeted, Shatrughan Sinha is a star campaigner of the Congress but he campaigns for SP and wears khaki pants of the RSS.

 Krishnam has been upset with the actor-turned-politician ever since the Lok Sabha elections when Krishnam was contesting the Lucknow Lok Sabha seat on the Congress ticket and Shatrughan Sinha was campaigning for his wife, Poonam Sinha, who was contesting on the SP ticket.

 Acharya Krishnam said that senior leaders like Santosh Singh and Satyadev Tripathi could be expelled without any reason but the actions of people like Shatrughan Sinha were being ignored by the party. Congress leader Zeeshan Haider also said that leaders whose loyalties lie with other parties should be shown the door.

 Ever since he joined the Congress, he has not bothered to visit the party office or meet party leaders but he regularly goes to the Samajwadi Party office, he said.

 Meanwhile, Shatrughan Sinha, when contacted, told IANS, Yashwant Sinha is my friend and I have been a part of his Gandhi Sandesh Yatra. The programme which you are talking about was a non-political function. I feel the controversy is being unnecessarily generated by some vested interests. There is no doubt about my loyalty to the Congress but there should be a difference between personal and political aspects of ones life.

1074,0,Gujarati,pqr,"Lucknow, Jan 28 (IANS) Pune 7Aces staged a stunning comeback and defeated Bengaluru Raptors 4-3 in their second tie of the season and eighth tie of the Premier Badminton League (PBL).

 The show on Monday evening was led by the doubles pairings of Chris and Gabrielle Adcock and Chirag Shetty and Hendra Setiawan who brought the tie back from a tense state to finally end it in favour of the outfit from Pune. Pune are now placed second in the points table with 10 points from two ties.

 The tie started with World No. 71 Kazumasa Sakai for Pune taking the court against Indias Ansal Yadav who was ranked many places below at 241 in the world ranking. It seemed as if young Yadav will take the first game against Sakai who was on the losing end in the last tie against the Rockets. Yadav went into the mid-game break leading 4-8 but Sakai finally brought his A game to the fore. There was no stopping for the Japanese international as he soon leveled the score after the break and finally closed the game 15-14 coming back from behind.

 After the dramatic comeback in game one, it was Sakai who took the initiative and smashed his way past the defence of the left-handed Yadav. Sakais attacking play was too much for the young Indian as he closed the game 15-9 and the match in straight games to give Pune 7Aces a 1-0 lead in the tie.

 In the second mens singles encounter, it was World No.36 Loah Kean Yew from Pune 7Aces who went up against Sai Praneeth.

 The first game was going toe-to-toe as Yew was trailing 5-6 when he got three quick points to go into the mid-game break leading 8-6. Yew and Praneeth were fighting for each point but Yews deception and attack combination worked very well and he closed the first game 15-10 in style.

 The second game though was a different story and went in favour of Praneeth by 7-15. The third game was more evenly contested but after leading initially Yew couldnt keep the same level of game throughout and finally ended up losing the game and match 8-15 after a hard-fought three-game encounter. The tie stood level at 1-1.

 In womens singles, world No.2 Tai Tzu Ying took to the stage against young Rituparna Das of Pune 7Aces in a trump match for the Raptors. Living up to her reputation the Taiwanese No.1 didnt make many mistakes and closed the first game 15-3.

 Though, Das was not ready to back down as she came back strongly in the second game and went into the mid-game break leading 8-2. But after the break, it was Ying who didnt give the young Indian much chance as she won 12 points on the trot to close the game 15-9 and the trump match in straight sets. With the win, Raptors went into a 3-1 lead.

 In mens doubles, Pune 7Aces had their hopes on the star-pairing of Hendra Setiawan and Chirag Shetty.

 Despite having such a strong pairing, 7Aces trailed at the mid-game break by a point against Arun George and Rian Saputro of the Raptors. It was game point 11 in favour of the Raptors but the World No.2 and No.10 pairing of the 7Aces came back in a heroic manner to win the game 15-14.

 The second game saw the Pune 7Aces pairing making a quick work of their opponents and closed the game 15-3 to win the game and the match in straight games to level the tie at 3-3.

 It was the decider with the mixed doubles encounter. Chris Adcock and Gabrielle Adcock of Pune 7Aces were going up against the pairing of World No.7 mixed doubles player Peng Soon Chan and World No.30 Eom Hye Won of the Raptors. The first game of the encounter went to the Raptors in a hard-fought game by a scoreline of 10-15.

 The second game was comeback time again for the 7Aces, as they went into the mid-game break leading 8-3. The change in the style of play with more attacking intent and better control over the net by the 7Aces was the key element till now. The 7Aces kept the lead alive and finally closed the game 15-11 to take the tie into a deciding game.

 The last game was being fought for each and every point and the Raptors went into the mid-game break with a point advantage. It was nail-biting stuff as there were no clear favourites till the very end but it was Pune 7Aces who were able to hold their nerves and closed the game and the match 15-12.

 The tie ended with Pune 7Aces winning the same 4-3.

1077,0,English,pqr,"Ash Barty stormed into her maiden Australian Open semi-final on Tuesday with an emphatic 7-6(6) 6-2 win over Petra Kvitova that avenged her defeat to the hard-hitting Czech in last years quarter-final at Melbourne Park.

 Thrashed 6-1 6-4 by eventual finalist Kvitova 12 months ago, top seed Barty rode a wave of crowd support as she defused the twice Wimbledon champions power game before running away with the contest on a glorious afternoon at Rod Laver Arena.

 Its been absolutely incredible, I knew I had to bring my absolute best against Petra, Barty said on court.

 I think Petra, in my eyes, is the perfect competitor.

 Regardless of whether she wins or loses shes always got a big grin on her face.

 I absolutely love testing myself against her.

 French Open champion Barty saved two break points serving for the match, then thumped down four first serves in succession, sealing the win in style with an ace.

 The 23-year-old became the first Australian woman to reach the semi-finals at Melbourne Park since Wendy Turnbull in 1984.

 She will play 14th seeded American Sofia Kenin, who earlier ended Tunisian Ons Jabeurs fairytale run, for a place in the final.

 Obviously shes having an incredible run, shes really developed her game over the last 12-18 months, Barty said of the Moscow-born Kenin.

 Its about me trying to get my running shoes on again.

 Im going to have nothing but a massive smile on my face when I walk out here on this beautiful court.

 Australia have not had a home winner at Melbourne Park since Chris ONeils triumph in the womens tournament in 1978 but the sports-mad nation may feel Barty is poised to break the drought.

 DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION

 Overwhelmed by Kvitovas firepower in their last meeting in Melbourne -- the Australians first appearance in the last eight of a Grand Slam -- a wiser, craftier Barty took the court for the rematch on Tuesday.

 She saved eight out of nine break points to keep Kvitova at bay in the first set, then scrambled brilliantly to claim the tiebreak.

 Driven to distraction by the Australians defence, Kvitova crumbled in the second set.

 She double-faulted to concede two break points and fell 3-0 behind, having reprieved Barty with a weak overhead smash and another poorly struck volley that pinged the top of the net.

 The volley gave Barty time to swoop forward, and true to her game, she lobbed Kvitova with a deft backhand rather than seek to pass her with needless brawn and aggression.

 Kvitova belatedly found her range and fired a searing backhand down the line to break back to 4-2 but it was more of a death rattle than a rally.

 The seventh seed dropped serve the next game with a sixth double-fault that put her within a game of defeat.

 The terraces gasped as Barty fired a forehand just wide to allow Kvitova two chances to break back when serving for the match.

 But soon after they were roaring in delight as Barty struck two aces in a four-point blitz to ensure she will be the talk of the nation through to Thursdays semi-final.

 Death row convict Mukesh Singh had filed a plea in the top court saying that the President of India had not paid enough attention to his plea and rejected it outrightly.

 Surabhi Pandey New Delhi  28 January 2020, 10:53:42 AM

 Ahead of the February 1st execution, the Supreme Court will hear the plea of one of Nirbhaya convicts against the rejection of his mercy plea on Tuesday. Death row convict Mukesh Singh had filed a plea in the top court saying that the President of India had not paid enough attention to his plea and rejected it outrightly. While agreeing for urgent hearing, Chief Justice of India Shard Arvind Bobde said, “If somebody is going to be executed on February 1, it is top priority. The Supreme Court bench headed by the Chief Justice of India asked the convict’s counsel to approach the mentioning officer as the hanging is scheduled on February 1. The bench also comprised Justices BR Gavai and Surya Kant. The warrant for execution of death sentence for the four convicts in the case has been fixed on February 1 at 6 am.

 On Saturday, advocate Vrinda Grover, who is representing Singh said that, A petition has been filed under Article 32 for judicial review of the manner of rejection of the mercy petition in terms of the judgement of Supreme Court in Shatrughan Chauhan case. The development came after the Centre moved the Supreme Court urging to seeking modification of the Shatrughan Chauhan judgment on rights available to death row convicts.

 The Supreme Court recently dismissed the curative petitions of other two convicts—Vinay and Mukesh Singh (32). Mukesh’s mercy petition was rejected by the President earlier this month. The 23-year-old paramedic student, referred to as Nirbhaya, was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012, in a moving bus in south Delhi by six people before she was thrown out on the road. She was flown to a hospital in Singapore where she died.

 Meanwhile, a dummy execution of the four death row convicts in the Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case was performed at Tihar Jail on Monday, prison officials said. This was the third instance of the jail authorities performing the dummy execution in order to test the equipment which will be used to hang the convicts, they said. The procedure was carried out in the afternoon and will be repeated over the next few days, the officials said, adding that the ropes were procured from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh.

 The dummies were created using sacks filled with wheat and sand as per the weight of the convicts, a senior jail official said.

1082,0,Tamil ,pqr,"The toll in the Wuhan coronavirus reached 106 in China on Tuesday, as 26 more deaths were reported in the country, the South China Morning Post said. The number of coronavirus cases, on the other hand, rose to over 4,500, as Chinese authorities confirmed 1,771 new cases on Tuesday morning.

 China’s National Health Commission said on Tuesday that apart from passing through the air, the virus is spread through physical contact with infected persons. The incubation period of the new virus is on average three to seven days, with the longest being 14 days, the commission said. It added that the coronavirus strain is 85% similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

 Authorities in Delhi on Monday isolated three people at the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, the Hindustan Times reported. Officials said the three had returned from China and exhibited flu-like symptoms.

 “Three people with suspected coronavirus were brought to the hospital today,” Dr Minakshi Bhardwaj, medical superintendent of Ram Manohar Lohia hospital said. “They had shown no symptoms after they came back from China and were living with their families in Delhi-NCR. They were brought to the hospital after they started showing some respiratory symptoms.”

 Two of these patients arrived in India last week, while the third had returned from China nearly a month ago.

 Meanwhile, in Kolkata, a Chinese tourist was admitted to the isolation ward of a government hospital. A Thai woman died at the Kolkata hospital after developing a respiratory illness.

 Three people, including two men aged 40 and another in his 30s from Pune, and a 36-year-old man from Mumbai have been quarantined in hospitals in the two cities, The Hindu reported on Tuesday. While the Mumbai patient, a resident of Tardeo, had visited Shanghai and Guangzhou in China, the man in his 30s from Pune had recently visited Shanghai.

 “The patient is vitally stable and has been put on symptomatic treatment,” Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Executive Health Officer Dr Padmaja Keskar said, referring to the Tardeo patient.

 One patient each has also been isolated in Jaipur, Chandigarh and Patna, with all three being Indian citizens who returned from China. Samples of all the patients have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune.

 So far, the institute has tested 14 out of the 17 samples sent to it for infection. None of the samples have tested positive. Three patients who had earlier been quarantined in Mumbai have also tested negative for the infection. However, they have been kept under observation, Dr. Archana Patil, a member of the Maharashtra Directorate of Health Services said.

 On Monday, Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to arrange special flights to evacuate Indians stranded in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak. He also requested Modi to give necessary instructions to the Indian Embassy in China to act proactively and provide necessary assistance to Indians, including people from Kerala stranded in Wuhan and Yichang.

 Nearly 200 people have been kept under observation in Kerala and Maharashtra, following screening for possible exposure to the virus. The Prime Minister’s Office on Saturday reviewed India’s preparedness to deal with the situation. India has also requested China to permit over 250 Indian students stuck in Wuhan to leave the city.

 The newly identified virus is believed to have originated late last year in a Wuhan market illegally selling wildlife.

 Sri Lanka reported its first case of a coronavirus infection on Monday, AP reported. The patient is a Chinese woman in her 40s who arrived in Sri Lanka last week as a tourist from China’s Hubei province, which is the region most affected by the epidemic.

 The woman was admitted to the Infectious Disease Hospital in Colombo on Saturday with fever. “She arrived on January 19 and was tested positive for the virus when she was leaving the airport on January 25,” Dr Sudath Suraweera, the chief epidemiologist of the country’s health ministry said.

 On Tuesday, Sri Lankan authorities suspended its policy of granting visa on arrival for Chinese travellers, PTI reported. Travellers from China now must apply for a visa on the website.

 Officials at Colombo international airport said the entry to airport’s arrival and departure terminals had been restricted to passengers only. Sri Lanka has evacuated 204 of its students from China so far, and more will arrive by flights on Tuesday.

 Sri Lanka on Monday appointed a National Action Committee to prevent the spreading of the coronavirus. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed the committee comprising health experts.

 Canada on Monday confirmed that a man had tested positive for the new virus, the first such case in the country, AFP reported. His wife has also tested positive, but her case has been listed as presumptive, pending final confirmation by a laboratory in Winnipeg, Canadian health authorities said.

 David Williams, Ontario province’s chief medical officer, said in a statement that the patient is a man in his 50s who returned from Wuhan to Toronto on January 22. He qualified the risk to others in Ontario as “low,” given that the woman has been in self-isolation.

 “We also have 19 persons under investigation for whom results are pending,” Barbara Yaffe, the Ontario province’s associate chief medical officer, told reporters in Montreal.

1083,0,Telugu,xyz,"Senior advocates Senior lawyers Kapil Sibal, Indira Jaisingh and Dushyant Dave have refuted claims that they had received money from the Popular Front of India in connection with the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, The Times of India reported on Tuesday. They threatened to take legal action for unsubstantiated allegations, and against any person/media organisation who tried to tarnish their reputation.

 The Enforcement Directorate had written a letter to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs alleging that Congress leader Sibal, and lawyers Jaising and Dave received payments from the Popular Front of India, The Indian Express reported on Monday. However, the letter did not mention that these funds were received for supporting protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

 “I completely and vehemently deny having received any money from PFI at any point of time, or receiving any money from any person or organisation in relation to anti-CAA protests,” Jaisingh said in a statement.

 My statement denying receipt of money from PFI in relation to anti CAA protests or for any other reason or purpose whatsoever.  @PTI_News @ZeeNews @ndtv @CNNnews18 @LiveLawIndia @barandbench @AltNews @scroll_in @thewire_in @the_hindu pic.twitter.com/HM1ECWDmxI

 The Enforcement Directorate had claimed that at least Rs 120 crore was deposited in the accounts of the Popular Front of India in Western Uttar Pradesh after the Citizenship Amendment Act was passed by Parliament on December 11 last year, PTI reported.

 The Enforcement Directorate alleged that scrutiny of a Popular Front of India account with the Syndicate Bank branch on Moovar Road in Kozhikode, Kerala, revealed that payments of Rs 3.77 crore were made to various individuals and persons. This includes payments to Sibal (Rs 77 lakh), Jaising (Rs 4 lakh), Dave (Rs 11 lakh), Popular Front of India Kashmir (Rs 1.65 crore), New Jyothi Group (1.17 crore), and a person called Abdul Samad (Rs 3.10 lakh). Samad is an accused against whom the National Investigation Agency has filed a chargesheet in a case related to a hawala network funding terror activities in India.

 In her statement, Jaising added: “The note showing details of transaction from the PFI account alleged to be made to me does not contain any signature or date, nor does it contain the name of the agency from where it has originated, and is therefore wholly unreliable.” The advocate warned that she would take “serious civil as well as criminal legal action” against persons or media houses who try to tarnish her reputation.

 Sibal said he received Rs 77 lakh as litigation fee for appearing in the Supreme Court between August 2017 and March 2018 for Hadiya in a case related to her marriage with Shafiya Jahan, reported IANS. He added that the money had nothing to do with the protests against the citizenship law. “In all matters in which I have appeared in the Supreme Court challenging constitutionality of the CAA, I have not raised, till date, any invoice,” he told The Times of India. “Any insinuations made to besmirch my name and defame me will be taken seriously.”

 Dave said it was known to the public that the PFI collected money for Hadiya’s legal battle. “It is very unfortunate that the issue is being raised now when the PFI had itself in 2018 made a statement that it had spent a total of Rs 99,52,324 on fighting Hadiya case,” he told the daily. “I appeared in the case thrice and one bill was raised for the appearance on October 9, 2017 for which we received the fee on October 30.”

 Hadiya’s marriage to a Muslim man, Shafin Jahan, was annulled by the Kerala High Court in May 2017. Her father had alleged that his daughter had been brainwashed and forced to convert to Islam. But the top court held that marriage and intimacy of personal relationships were at the core of India’s plurality and that the state could not be allowed to make “inroads into this extremely personal space”.

 Popular Front of India General Secretary Mohammad Ali Jinnah claimed that his organisation had not funded the protests against the amended Citizenship Act. He also said payments shown against the names of Sibal, Dave and Jaising were made in connection with the Hadiya marriage case, and were publicly declared.

 The Popular Front of India claimed that it “fully complies with the law of the land, and allegation of Rs 120 crore transferred from [its] accounts just before CAA protest is totally baseless…Popular Front of India does not have any wing or branch in Jammu and Kashmir”.

 The Citizenship Amendment Act provides citizenship to refugees from six minority religious communities from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, provided they have lived in India for six years and entered the country by December 31, 2014. The Act has been widely criticised for excluding Muslims. Twenty-six people died in last month’s protests against the law – all in the BJP-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam.

1084,0,Hindi,abc,"Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee on Monday suggested that the government should consider bringing back the wealth tax given the kind of inequality present in India. “In general, more redistribution makes perfect sense to me,” he said at the Kolkata Literary Meet, according to The Telegraph.

 He, however, added that he does not expect it to happen right now. “I hear all the vibes about a tax cut for the middle classes,” said Banerjee. “I don’t think that is where the leverage points are. To be honest I am less worried about budget deficit, it’s never been what it claims to be…. I think government can do better.”

 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharam is scheduled to present the Union Budget on February 1. The wealth tax was first put in place in 1957. However, the Narendra Modi government had scrapped the wealth tax in 2015 because of a high cost of collections and a low yield. Total wealth tax collected in 2013-’14 was only Rs 1,008 crore. The wealth tax was replaced with an additional surcharge of 2% on the super rich with a taxable income of over Rs 1 crore annually.

 The Indian-American economist said India could be passing through a phase of recession but there was no way to know it. “We are just picking up the symptoms,” he said. “The statistical apparatus is incapable of capturing short-term data on the informal sector.”

 “If you ask me, could we be in a recession? There is nothing in data that says we could not be in a recession,” said Banerjee, according to IANS. He, however, cited the example of sale of two-wheelers, which have been hit by a slowdown . “It is the informal sector that buys the two-wheelers,” he added.

 Banerjee said the first reaction to an economic problem like demand slowdown was to cut corporate tax. “To me, it’s like we are in a time warp,” he said. “We do not see where we are. The corporate sector is actually sitting on cash and not doing much with it because there is no demand. We have a mindset of making policies, which are based on some model of economics where all the dynamism is to be provided by the rich. This doesn’t seem to be true.”

 The economist said that the priority of the government should be on refinancing the banking sector, but warned that it will take time to yield results. “The banking sector is in doldrums,” he said. “It needs huge funding by the government. The Centre should also look at infrastructure sector funding.”

 The growth rate of the Indian economy has plummeted over the last three years. In the second quarter of 2019-’20, the Gross Domestic Product recorded a six-year-low growth rate of 4.5%. The government has predicted that India will grow at just 5% for 2019-’20, the lowest in 11 years. Meanwhile, retail inflation rose to a five-and-half year high of 7.35% in December 2019. The government had in September last year slashed the corporate tax rate for domestic firms from 35% to 22%.

 Banerjee also favoured the central government’s move to privatise public sector undertakings like Air India. “I would love to sell out the prestigious PSUs,” he said when asked on the Centre’s disinvestment plan, according to The Indian Express. On Monday, the Centre said it was for planning to sell its entire stake in Air India. The move has been criticised by Congress leaders Kapil Sibal and Sandeep Dixit as well as Bharatiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy.

 The professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said “the fringes of the ruling party” was trying “to demonise a population”. He said in India, like in the United States, the minorities were not anywhere close to being dominant. “I don’t think there is any real fear that there is going to be a Muslim takeover of India,” he said, according to The Telegraph. “Whenever these fears are stoked, you could imagine a context when these are two equal groups, and you worry about the other group becoming too powerful. This is just not realistic here… [it] is constructing a narrative that has no basis in reality.”

 Banerjee said there was no evidence that migrants depress low-income wages. “People have this idea [migrants will take away their jobs] because they have learnt economics in high school,” said the Nobel laureate. “One of the dangers of learning economics at high school is [that] you learn it half way. So you learn that there is a supply curve and a demand curve. And when the supply curve moves, more people come in and the price goes down, (and) wages go down. What people forget is that when people migrate they don’t live on air. They buy stuff. So you know it also moves demand.”

 Banerjee said “economic migrants” are enterprising people. “They tend to actually add a lot to the economy,” he added. “...When a lot of people come, you end up in a slightly different job. You become the manager for these people, the newcomers; you start a restaurant to feed them. So, people actually reallocate to absorb them.”

 NCP spokesperson and Maharashtra Minister Nawab Malik on Tuesday condemned the statement made by Congress leader Ashok Chavan on seeking a written assurance from the Shiv Sena before the formation of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra. Malik denied Ashok Chavans statement and said that all three parties in the MVA sat together and signed the Common Minimum Programme.

 Speaking to the media Malik said, His(Ashok Chavan) statement that Congress has taken written note from Shiv Sena is wrong. All three parties sat together and signed the Common Minimum Programme. CMP surely follows preamble of the Constitution. His statement is inappropriate. According to me, his statement has been taken in the wrong manner.

 Further speaking about the NRC and CAA Malik said, NRC will not be implemented in Maharashtra but if any proposal or resolution comes then all three parties will first discuss on the proposal then only any decision will be taken, no single party can take a call, our CM Uddhav has said that we will not implement CAA and NRC.

 Earlier on Monday, in a sensational revelation, former Maharashtra CM and Congress Ashok Chavan said that party chief Sonia Gandhi had sought for a written assurance from Shiv Sena before extending their support in Maharashtra. The Congress leader divulged that the saffron party and a former BJP ally had to give it in writing that his party will not act or do anything against the Constitution. The condition was accepted by Uddhav Thackeray, thus paving a path for a contrasting alliance in Maharashtra between Sena-NCP-Congress.

 Ashok Chavan said, Sonia Gandhi told us that you need to get it in writing that the government will function as per the constitution. If it deviates from the preamble we will walk out of government. We told this to Uddhav Thackeray. Shiv Sena accepted it.

 In the world of health and wellness, there are mixed opinions for the vegan diet, some say it has numerous benefits, while there are others who feel it can lead to nutritional deficiency.

 We are only days away from the first trailer of the upcoming horror film, Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship. The movie backed by Dharma Productions, features Vicky Kaushal as the main lead and Bhumi Pednekar in a supporting role. The first few posters of the film got the ball rolling. Now, the entire digital presence of Dharma has gone under a revamp for the films promotion. Dharma Goes Dark, the digital campaign is lovingly being called. The iconic golden logo of the banner has gone black. And, more interestingly, the signature tune of the hit film, Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, also recieved a horror revamp.

 You know how we get to hear Kuch Kuch Hota Hais signature tune, every time the Dharma logo unfolds on the screen. So, announcing the new digital campaign for Bhoot, the makers used a creepy version of the tune. It is brief but gripping, especially for the horror fans. Bhoot-Part One: The Haunted Ship: Vicky Kaushals Spine-Chilling Look Will Impress the Horror Movie Lover in You (View Pic).

 This is a popular trend in Hollywood to revamp old songs for horror movies. The hit rap song, I Got 5 On It by Luniz was revamped for Jordan Peeles horror film, Us. It gave the trailer and the film a very creepy vibe. For The Gallows, Nirvanas Smells Like Teen Spirit was revamped giving it a very gothic tone, to promote the trailer.

 Check Out The Video Here:

 The original tune of Kuch Kuch Hota Hai was composed by Jatin Lalit in 1998. The song is an evergreen classic. Wed love to get reactions from the stars who featured in the original song - Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol and Rani Mukerji - on the new creepy version.

 Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship is the first of the intended franchise of horror films that Karan Johar wants to make. The movie was slated to release in November 2019, but the makers pushed the released date to February 21, 2020. The makers announced that they needed more time with the high-scale post-production work.

1093,0,Hindi,abc,"A robot that bakes the well-loved meal was a big hit at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, wowing onlookers as it prepared 300 pies an hour. The developer, a Seattle-based startup called Picnic, insists that pizza is only the beginning: “Our system will soon be able to make a wide variety of foods including sandwiches, salads, bowls, and more.

 And why not? After all, robot bartenders, including for the home, are all the rage (although the top-of-the-line model will set you back the price of a luxury car). Moreover, with labor costs rising and margins falling, no one doubts that the future of the food service industry is automation, both behind the counter and in the kitchen.

 Still, there seems to be something special about robots and pizza. Domino’s, the world’s biggest pizza chain, touts its “autonomous delivery vehicle, which is being tested in Houston. Big rival Little Caesar holds a patent on its own “apparatus ... for assembling pizza — that is, a pizza-making robot. And learned papers in serious journals explain the best way to teach an autonomous system to roll pizza ... or even to select ingredients.

 Well, of course. The world market for freshly baked pizza is nearing $150 billion a year, according to a 2019 report in PMQ Pizza Magazine, an industry trade publication. The largest share — over $50 billion — is in the U.S., but the fastest growth over the next five years is expected in Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. In China alone, annual sales are forecast to grow 21.6% by 2024.

 That’s a lot of demand, but there’s also a lot of competition. For sellers of freshly baked pizza, as for others in the food service industry, rising labor costs and thinning margins make increased automation inevitable. Still, there’s no reason just yet for technophobes to panic — or, for that matter, for technophiles to celebrate. We have some time yet before being overwhelmed by the pizza-robot apocalypse.

 Picnic’s automaton is undeniably fun and impressive to watch. It looks good too, sleek and unindustrial. One observer wrote that the robot resembles “a white, kitchen-sized iPhone. It’s easy to see why the device has earned such fawning coverage — and why Picnic has already signed up some big customers.

 Still, there are reasons to be cautious in our enthusiasm. First among them is the elephant in the room: the cautionary tale of Zume. Headquartered in Mountain View, California, Zume was a legitimate unicorn, with the clever idea of baking pizzas in special ovens inside its trucks, using GPS technology to determine when to heat the pies so that they would arrive fresh and hot at the customer’s doorstep. SoftBank’s single investment in the startup in 2018, which was greater than the total amount raised by all other robot-food-preparation startups combined over the previous five years, implied a value for the company of over $2 billion. The company even earned a cameo on the HBO drama “Silicon Valley. As recently as two months ago — yes, I’m talking about November of 2019 — Vox Recode predicted that Zume might soon be worth $4 billion.

 Oops.

 Earlier this month, Zume shuttered its pizza operation, cutting 172 jobs in Mountain View and 80 more in San Francisco. Going forward, Zume plans to focus now on sustainable food packaging.

 Here’s a second reason for caution: Despite heady media claims that pizza is now being made by artificial intelligence (and a similar suggestion from the company itself), Picnic’s device doesn’t quite earn that encomium. I tend to agree with Melanie Mitchell of the Sante Fe Institute, who argues in her excellent 2019 book “Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans that what’s crucial to humanlike thought is the ability to apply common sense, a challenge researchers find difficult. We should avoid crying “AI every time a device masters a particular task previously done by humans, even when the task is complex, like playing chess ... or making pizza.

 And Picnic’s robot, though quite ingenious, isn’t artificially intelligent just yet. Here’s radio station KIRO:

 “The human touch is still very much required for the machine to function. It has a vision system that reads the size and shape of the dough, and places the toppings and sauce on using a conveyor belt, but the dough and sauce must be made by actual human beings, who also have to put the pizza in the oven.

 This is impressive but not revolutionary. Automated assembly lines for automobiles do nearly as much, and have been around longer. As KIRO puts it, “The pizza-making robot is really good at making the easiest part of the pizza.

 But a system need not be artificially intelligent to be efficient and useful, and it’s easy to believe that Picnic is pointing the way toward the future. Picnic certainly isn’t Zume. For one thing, Picnic’s system is simpler. It lacks articulating arms and consists instead of “a series of modular, customizable food dispensers. Even if the device currently performs only the easiest part of the operation, one assumes that its capabilities will improve over time. For another, unlike Zume, Picnic isn’t in the pizza business; it’s in the robot business.(1)

 When the news from CES hit the web, Connecticut’s Senator Chris Murphy took to Twitter to tell the world that he’s unimpressed: “It already feels like pizza made outside Connecticut/New Haven is made by mindless robots anyway, so I’m not sure how this would affect 99% of the country.

 Cute. But with so many restaurants struggling to pay their bills, and with technology improving all the time, it’s fair to say that the future of pizza (and of the rest of food service) belongs to the bots.

That’s often described as the point where the only people who are unemployed are those temporarily in between jobs, and beyond which unemployment is so low that it sparks inflation.

1098,0,Tamil ,pqr,"Global aviation consultancy firm CAPA has termed the government’s decision to sell 100 per cent stake in Air India a “bold reform” and said it expects “significant” response from the prospective bidders. “The Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) expects significant response (to Air India’s stake sale) as the offer structured by the government is attractive,” CAPA India chief Kapil Kaul told PTI on Monday.

 He said the time given for due diligence and submitting bids is also reasonable. The government on Monday announced sale of 100 per cent stake in debt-laden Air India as it issued the preliminary bid document for the strategic disinvestment and has set March 17, as the deadline for submitting expression of interest.

 As part of the strategic disinvestment, Air India would also sell 100 per cent stake in low-cost airline Air India Express and 50 per cent shareholding in joint venture AISATS, according to a bid document issued on Monday. The airline’s management control would also be transferred to the successful bidder.

 This is the second time in less than two years that the government has come out with proposal for selling stake in Air India, which has been in the red for long. The government has set March 17 as the deadline for submitting the expression of interest. AISATS is an equal joint venture between Air India and Singapore Airlines. It offers ground-handling services.

 “Clean exit by the government and entire non-aircraft-related debts taken out of AI (Air India) balance sheet, particularly as entire debt excluding aircraft is taken out and this signals a determined effort to exit Air India to allow taxpayers funds be utilised for social agenda of the government,” he said.

 Noting that this may be the single-biggest write-off by the government but for the right reasons, Kaul said, “CAPA see this as a very bold reform.”

1099,0,Tamil ,pqr,"The industrial output in December is once again expected to contract after a marginal recovery in the previous month. In the three months to October, India’s industrial output consecutively shrank on the back of slow economic growth. “Based on the weaker performance of the manufacturing sectors and non-oil exports, we expect the Index of Industrial Production to revert to a mild contraction in December 2019 from the modest growth in November 2019,” said credit rating agency ICRA in its report. However, it also said that the contraction of the core sector industries is likely to narrow further in December 2019, benefitting from the improvement in coal and electricity, which would offset the deterioration in crude oil and refinery output.

 Partly driven by an unfavourable base effect, as much as 11 out of 18 economic indicators recorded a deterioration in the month of December, compared to the previous months. The waning of the favourable base effects was observed in indicators such as crude oil production, non-oil exports, passengers carried by domestic airlines, and consumption of ATF, diesel, and petrol.

 Among these indicators, the performance of crude oil production was mainly affected. The crude oil production has reportedly worsened to 7.4 per cent in December 2019 from 6 per cent in the previous month. Also, the refinery output contracted by 1 per cent in December 2019, compared to 3.8 per cent growth in November 2019.

 On the brighter side, the growth in seven of the lead indicators such as the production of commercial vehicles, Coal India Limited (CIL), bank deposits as well as traffic-related to ports cargo and railway freight, displayed a sequential improvement in December 2019. The Indian economy has been going through a phase of a prolonged slowdown in recent months, however, signs of early recovery have started to appear as the rural part of the country has started to regain the lost momentum.

1102,0,English,abc,"The countrys largest car maker Maruti Suzuki, on January 28, is expected to report double-digit growth in profit, revenue and operating income YoY for the quarter ended December 2019.

 The stock rallied nearly 10 percent during the quarter, in line with Nifty Auto index (up 10 percent and outperformed Nifty50 up, 6 percent).

 Brokerages expect the profit to rise in the range of 12-30 percent (YoY) during the quarter driven by strong operating income and realisation per unit. The low base of last year was the main reason for double-digit growth as the company reported decline in profit for last five quarters.

 Revenue is likely to grow more than 11 percent compared to year-ago on account of increase in volumes and realisation.

 Maruti sold more than 4.37 lakh units in December quarter, increased by 2 percent YoY and 29 percent sequentially.

 We expect revenues to increase by 16 percent YoY in Q3FY20 led by (1) 2 percent YoY in increase in volumes and (2) 9 percent YoY increase in ASPs due to introduction of new safety regulations for entry-level cars and migration of the petrol portfolio to BS-VI, said Kotak Institutional Equities which expects profit growth of 17.3 percent YoY.

 The operating performance during the quarter is expected to be strong with strong margin expansion despite higher discounts, driven by product-mix and better operating leverage.

 We expect MSILs operating margins to improve around 190bps QoQ due to driven by – 1) better mix – higher share of diesel vehicles; 2) easing commodity costs and operating leverage benefits, said Edelweiss which sees profit growth of 30 percent YoY and 43 percent QoQ, and EBITDA growth of 29 percent YoY/55 percent QoQ.

 Kotak expects EBITDA to increase by 33 percent YoY in Q3FY20 led by (1) 16 percent YoY increase in revenues and (2) 148 bps expansion in margin driven by operating leverage benefits, partly offset by higher discounts. The quarter-on-quarter expansion in margin could be 184bps.

 The focus of the government is on developing infrastructure and real estate as these sectors provide immense opportunities for generating employment. The Sagarmala Programme is one such initiative by the Government of India to improve transport infrastructure. The government is also considering various incentives for salaried individuals for promoting investment and savings. Some of the asks from the industry are provided below:

 A. Financial Markets

 Simplification:

 Currently, the holding period to qualify as long term capital gains in case of investment in equity shares, mutual funds, debt oriented funds, properties, equity shares etc. varies. One of the objective of the government is to bring simplification in tax laws and to make it easy to implement and be less litigative.

 Below is the table providing the holding period of various securities with the corresponding tax rates:

 There is a strong case to rationalise the holding period with reasonable tax rates and bring in uniformity across various investments to make the provisions comprehensible and reduce inadvertent evasion.

 B. Investment avenues:

 Infra bonds - Re-introduction of the deduction in respect of subscription to infrastructure bonds by individuals. This will also help the government to mobilise funds for investment in infra sector and thereby boost the economy.

 Additional investment in the real estate sector - The government’s motto is to provide housing for all. To boost the real estate sector, the government should consider enhancing the limit for deduction of interest paid on housing loan to Rs 3,00,000 in case of a self-occupied property.

 Additional deduction of Rs 1,50,000 was provided to first time home buyers in the Finance Act 2019. One of the conditions to avail this benefit is that the stamp duty value of such property should not exceed Rs 45 lakh – this denies full usage of the benefit of additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh for all the years. As such, the ceiling on the cost of the house needs to be significantly enhanced to derive the full potential of the benefit.

 Additional saving through increase in 80C limit - The deduction under Section 80C has remained static since Finance Act, 2014. The section is meant to provide relief to individuals for specified investments and expenditure, while at the same time channelise investments into areas that support the economy. At this juncture, it is expected that there will be an increase in these limits. With the economic slowdown, the government could consider enhancing the existing limit of INR 150,000 to INR 200,000.

 Increase in limit for NPS - NPS comes under an EET (exempt, exempt, tax) regime. Withdrawals from the NPS are taxable to the extent of 40 percent. However, EPF and PPF are on EEE (exempt, exempt, exempt) regime. For the scheme to be successful, it has to be brought at par with other retirement schemes by making withdrawals tax exempt.

 The contribution by employer to NPS up to 10 percent of basic pay of the individual, is deductible. NPS for the government sector was increased from 12-14 percent last year - a similar increase is expected for the private sector as well.

 C. Abolish dividend distribution tax (DDT)

 Dividends paid by a domestic company are subject to dividend distribution tax at 15 percent. The rate is further increased by surcharge and cess. The government is considering removal of DDT based on industry representations. The revenue loss is likely to be compensated by introducing tax on dividends in the hands of shareholders. Caution needs to be exercised by adopting a reasonable tax rate.

1104,0,Tamil ,pqr,"US aerospace giant Boeing has identified India as one of its top markets and critical to its international growth plans, eyeing the countrys plans to buy fighter jets worth billions of dollars.

 The statement of Dennis Swanson, vice president, International Sales, Boeing Global Sales and Marketing came ahead of his visit to Indias mega defence exhibition to be held in Lucknow from February 5-9.

 In April, the Indian Air Force issued an initial tender to acquire 114 jets at a cost of around USD 18 billion, billed as one of the worlds biggest military procurement in recent years.

 The top contenders for the deal include Lockheeds F-21, Boeings F/A-18, Dassault Aviations Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Russian aircraft Mig 35 and Saabs Gripen.

 India is one of the top markets for Boeing and critical to our international growth plans. As one of the fastest growing economies in the world, India offers growth and productivity opportunities, as well as talent and technology innovation advantages, Swanson told PTI on Monday.

 Boeing has established a growing defence installation base, invested in manufacturing, skill development and engineering in India, and contributed to developing the aerospace and defence ecosystem that is being built on technology advancement and innovation, said Swanson, who is co-leading a high-powered delegation of US India Business Council to DefExpo 2020 along with David Sutton, director for the Indo-Pacific, Lockheed Martin International.

 Over 1,000 companies from nearly 70 countries will take part in the biggest-ever DefExpo to be held in Lucknow from February 5-9, according to a Defence Ministry statement in New Delhi.

 Responding to a question on Indias multi-billion fighter jet acquisition deal, Swanson said that Boeings F/A-18 Super Hornet is the latest Block III configuration that offers India the latest technologies and capabilities.

 Our F/A-18 Super Hornet Block III offers the Indian Navy a unique and differentiated capability in the form of an advanced, combat proven, multi-role naval fighter that is fully compatible with the Indian Navy carriers and would boost the growing maritime and defence relationship between the US and India, he said.

 Designed as a carrier-based fighter for high-loading, high stress operations with minimal support equipment required, the Super Hornet Block III is fully compliant with and ideally suited for the Indian Navys carrier deck, and as demonstrated in flight trials, it can take off from Indian aircraft carriers via ski jump. It is also compatible with air refuelling tankers operated around the world, Swanson said.

 Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in December visited Naval Air Station Oceana on the invitation of the US government and toured the F/A-18 squadron and sat in an aircraft.

 With the Super Hornet being the frontline fighter for the US Navy, cooperation between the two navies in naval aviation can result in the sharing of upgrades and knowledge, Swanson said.

 The F/A-18 can unlock the potential of cooperation in naval aviation, with the sharing of best practices in modern naval aviation systems, carrier integration know-how, services and training and weapon systems, he said.

 In addition, the F/A-18s integration with Indian carriers would demonstrate Indias commitment as a Major Defence Partner and the Asia Pacific Reassurance Initiative, serving as an important symbol of the new relationship between the US and India, he asserted.

 Boeing, he said, has a long standing partnership with the Indian armed forces, with the C-17, Apache, Chinook and P-8I aircraft playing an important role in mission-readiness for the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy.

 With a supply chain of over 200 partners in India, and a joint venture with Tata that is manufacturing fuselages for Apache helicopters in Hyderabad, Boeing is partnering with Indian industry to grow the indigenous aerospace industry in the country, he said.

 According to Swanson, over USD 1 billion of products and services sourced from India go into the most advanced Boeing aircraft across its commercial and defence businesses.

 While we have quadrupled sourcing from India in the last five years, we are also investing in talent, training and skill development now and for the future, he said.

 Boeing currently employs 3,500 people in India, and more than 7,000 people work with its supply chain partners, he said, noting that the company overall makes an impact on more than 1,50,000 lives.

 Swanson said Boeings research and development (R&D) presence in India includes partnerships with research partners in academia, research laboratories and industry - including IITs, IISC, and the Department of Science and Technology.

 It supports aerospace research and co-development of technologies in India to address future technical challenges in aerospace.

 The US company has established a Boeing Research & Technology India (BIETC) center that conducts research in areas such as flight sciences, materials and processes, and structures and software with Indian research partners.

 BIETC in Bengaluru and Chennai growing rapidly and is expected to employ 4,000 engineers by this year, he said.

 Our engineers undertaking complex aerospace work to support diverse areas across the local and international ecosystem. They also perform engineering activities in the areas of mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering for current and future aircraft, Swanson added.

1105,0,Hindi,pqr,"Budget shall lay huge focus on farmers credit, incentives through DBT for assisting farmers get their share for inputs required for farming, improved mechanisation/better irrigation facilities, better yield for their products and access to the direct market mechanism, Mayuresh Joshi, Head of Equity - India, William O’Neil India, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

 Edited excerpt:

 A) The government shall need to generate incentives surrounding growth as most of our macro indicators have looked fragile. In addition, the stoking of inflation, soft tax collections both Direct and Indirect, weak private CAPEX (which is expected to pick up with the tax rates for new units announced earlier by the Exchequer) and increasing the gross domestic savings as a % to GDP are some of the challenges encountered at this point of time.

 So, in my opinion, it shall be a growth-oriented Budget with focus laid out on three broad aspects:

 a) Doubling of farmers income by FY22: It shall lay a huge focus on farmers credit, incentives through DBT for assisting farmers to get their share for inputs required for farming, improved mechanisation/better irrigation facilities, the better yield for their products and access to the direct market mechanism.

 Such announcements were done, if any, shall boost rural productivity and create a multiplier effect in consumption as rural growth has de-grown urban growth in the past fiscal.

 A better RABI output shall also act as a trigger point along with such measures to boost demand and correspondingly growth and also in better corporate earnings a few quarters down the line.

 b) Affordable housing and Infrastructure: Though lot has been said/spoken in the past, there, in my opinion, shall be firm/time-bound steps in these aspects with most of the planned capital expenditure directed towards this aspect.

 Getting projects that need to be implemented on the Government side with timely financial closures and proper execution shall be in my opinion put under the scanner as well as getting private participation where a majority due diligence shall be done and projects need to be completed and delivered shall take precedence.

 Also, the affordable housing efforts to gain speed with further incentives and support that may get announced can create a spiral effect for a lot of inputs associated with the sector viz. cement, steel, home improvement players etc.

 c) Availability of Credit: Measures that may get announced in providing credit to the sectors that need liquidity and also the manner and mechanism in which the same can be achieved.

 Resolution of NCLT cases provides relief to the sector but NBFCs getting liquidity support and the aforesaid two factors contributing can get the boost that the economy needs with both the consumption and supply factors working at play in tandem.

 Q) Do you think Govt. will be able to meet this fiscal deficit target? If not, what is the extent of slippage you are looking at which market would be comfortable with?

 A) With the tax collection figures (both Direct and Indirect) looking soft, divestments so far not expected to meet the mark, larger borrowings from the market and the provisioning related to the subsidies shall cause stress in meeting the Fiscal Deficit numbers.

 My belief is that a 20-30bps slippage can be accepted by the market as it has been an extraordinary year for most economies and the GDP forecast downgrades for a majority of the economies conducted by the IMF which is an outcome of fiscal imbalances in most countries shall bear testimony that a small slippage should be accepted by the markets.

 The bond market movement in terms of the same shall also need to be monitored but the yield curve so far is indicating that it is gestating the same in terms of a slight miss on the number.

 Q) Which are the sectors that are likely to hog the limelight in this Budget 2020 and why?

 A) Banking and Financial Services, Agri and Agri inputs, and Infrastructure.

 Q) What are the expectations from Budget 2020 from investors or market perspective?

 A) Large expectations are cut in personal income tax rates, leeway in capital gains, reduction in STT and CTT.

 Q) Do you think infrastructure could turn out to be a strong beneficiary in the upcoming Budget?

 A) I believe it would as sound infrastructure spending creates benefits that can be reaped by a lot of other consuming sectors.

 Q) The govt struggled to meet the divestment target in FY20. What are the estimates you are factoring in for the next fiscal?

 A) My belief is that the next fiscal shall provide plenty of opportunities for the government to meet its divestment target. It also gives them enough time to do complete due diligence and get roper bids in terms of efforts that they initiated to privatize Air India and BPCL. My belief that a target of 1.25 lakh crores is plausible next fiscal.

 In the main event segment, Edge made an emotional comeback to WWE Raw after announcing retirement nine years back, saying he has the grit to take to the squared circle once again and he is gonna give it a go the second time around till his body allows him.

 But, Randy Orton interfered segment and teased a reunion of Rated RKO, before hitting the patented cutter on Edge and then proceeded to hit Edge with stell chairs. He then placed a steel chair on the neck of Edge (neck injury had forced Edge to retire), and took to the top rope, but contemplated his next, to build the tension, However, he climbed down, took two more chairs and proceeded to hit Edge on the head before leaving his former tag partner lying in shock.

 McIntyre’s monster push continued as he was pitted against the Original OC’s Karl Anderson and Luke Gallows in a handicap match which McIntyre won without much trouble. Also in the show was the return of MVP, who made a surprise return at the Rumble, and fans were treated to a vintage match featuring MVP and Rey Mysterio, which the latter won.

 Aleister Black continued to build momentum after a good Rumble showing, defeating local talent Kenneth Johnson while Raw tag teams champions Seth Rollins and Buddy Murphy defeated Samoa Joe and Kevin Owens.

1110,0,English,pqr,"Kolkata: A last-gasp header from substitute Balwant Singh saw ATK pip NorthEast United 1-0 and go top of the Indian Super League (ISL) ladder at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Monday (January 27).

 The hosts created plenty of chances but were wasteful until an injury-time strike from substitute Balwant proved to be the difference. Despite his absence from the touchline, Antonio Habas side return to the top of the table, level on points with FC Goa who also have 27 points from 14 matches. The Highlanders remain ninth with 11 points from as many games.

 Also read: Bengaluru FC bounce back

 In-form ATK striker Roy Krishna had the NorthEast defence on red alert early on with his dangerous runs off the ball. After a couple of unsuccessful runs down the right flank, Prabir Das delivered an excellent cross in his third try and it almost found Krishnas run into the box, until Kai Heering made a crucial interception to deny the Fijian a shot on target.

 The visitors had their first sight of the ATK goal minutes later. Having received the ball outside the box, midfielder Lalengmawia beat his marker, entered the box and sent his effort just wide.

 The tempo of the game slowed down after the early attempts at both ends. ATK looked more likely to open the scoring but couldnt find a way past an organized NorthEast defence.

 Both goalkeepers were called into action just before the break. Edu Garcia slid a clever through-ball into the box for Krishna in the 39th minute. The ATK strikers shot from a one-on-one situation was saved by Subhasish Roy Chowdhury with his feet.

 At the stroke of half-time, a Ninthoinganba Meetei cross met Martin Chaves whose header from inside the box forced a fingertip save from goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya.

 Robert Jarni hoped to gain a foothold in the game by bringing on Jose Leudo and Federico Gallego as the teams walked out for the second half but the hosts continued to threaten.

 The influential Garcia once again produced a brilliant through-ball into the box, this time for Michael Soosairaj who ran in behind the defence and attempted to poke a finish into the net. With the keeper well beaten, Mislav Komorskis goalline clearance kept the scoreline intact.

 Defender Pritam Kotal was next in line to be presented with another big chance to score in the 68th minute. A Javier Hernandez free-kick caused chaos inside the box and the ball looped towards Kotal whose impatient strike flew over the bar.

 There were chances for both teams to settle the matter towards the end. Nikhil Kadam’s through-ball almost sent Gallego through on goal but for Arindam’s quick intervention. At the other end, Mislav Komorski came up with two crucial interventions to deny Krishna and Prabir Das.

 Just when it looked like the teams would have to share the spoils, substitute Balwant produced a match-winner in the last of the four added minutes. The striker, who came off the bench for Edu Garcia in the 90th minute and was left unmarked inside the box for a Hernandez corner-kick, headed the ball into the net to the delight of the home crowd.

In a career spanning 17 years, Ponting won three World Cups (two as captain), two Champions Trophy titles, won over 100 Tests as a player, had multiple Ashes triumphs and played countless bilateral series. During his playing days, the maverick Tasmanian was considered as the second-best batsman behind India’s Sachin Tendulkar.

 Responding to the user’s query, Ricky Ponting recalled the time when he was living at the cricket academy in 1990 where he was getting paid $40 a month. He said that he used to bet on dog races to make ends meet and hence, Shane Warne started calling him Punter. Incidentally, both Shane Warne and Ricky Ponting went on to pivotal roles in Australia’s dominance in world cricket during the late 1990s and early 2010s.

 NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are planning to launch the ‘Solar Orbiter’, a new spacecraft that will travel to the Sun to capture the first pictures of its north and south poles. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Venus and Earth to swing itself out of the ecliptic plane — the swath of space, roughly aligned with the Sun’s equator, where all planets orbit.

 The spacecraft will launch from Cape Canaveral on February 7, 2020, at 11:15 pm EST which converts to 9:45 am IST on February 8, 2020. Once the spacecraft is out of the ecliptic plane, it will proceed to snap the first-ever look at the Sun’s poles with its bird’s eye view, NASA said.

 “Up until Solar Orbiter, all solar imaging instruments have been within the ecliptic plane or very close to it,” said Russell Howard, space scientist at the Naval Research Lab in Washington, DC and principal investigator for one of Solar Orbiter’s ten instruments. “Now, we’ll be able to look down on the Sun from above.”

 The Sun plays a central role in shaping space around us as we know it and its massive magnetic field stretches far beyond Pluto, paving a superhighway for charged solar particles known as the solar wind. “When bursts of solar wind hit Earth, they can spark space weather storms that interfere with our GPS and communications satellites — at their worst, they can even threaten astronauts,” NASA said.

 These space images taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope look like modern art

 The scientists monitor the Sun’s magnetic field in order to prepare for arriving solar storms but we only get a sidelong glimpse of the Sun’s poles from within the ecliptic plane, which leaves major gaps in the data.

 “The poles are particularly important for us to be able to model more accurately,” said Holly Gilbert, NASA project scientist for the mission at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “For forecasting space weather events, we need a pretty accurate model of the global magnetic field of the Sun.”

 The only prior spacecraft to fly over the Sun’s poles was also a joint ESA/NASA venture launched in 1990. The Ulysses spacecraft made three passes around the Sun before being decommissioned in 2009. However, while Ulysses never got closer than Earth-distance to the Sun, the Solar Orbiter will pass inside the orbit of Mercury carrying four in situ instruments (which measure the space environment immediately around the spacecraft like the sense of touch) and six remote-sensing imagers (which see the Sun from afar).

 After years of technology development, it will be the closest any Sun-facing cameras have ever gotten to the Sun. “You can’t really get much closer than Solar Orbiter is going and still look at the Sun,” Müller said.

 Foldable phones are a thing now. It all started last year when Samsung and Huawei launched their respective foldable phones Galaxy Fold and Mate X at Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2019. This year’s MWC event will also likely witness the launch of several foldable smartphones.

 More and more manufacturers are working on foldable phones right now. There’s Motorola who launched the new Motorola Razr flip phone, which is heading to India very soon. The company is now said to bring a 5G version of its Razr flip phone. The existing one comes with 4G support and is powered by Snapdragon 710 processor.

 Then there’s Samsung again, who reportedly plans to launch yet another foldable phone in the upcoming Unpacked event that’s set for February 11. This one from Samsung is said to the Galaxy Z Flip which is expected to come with clamshell like design. It now appears and HMD Global — finally — is joining the competition soon with its first foldable phone.

 Here’s how much the upcoming Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip foldable phone could cost

 The latest report from Nokiamob, a website that keeps a track of new and upcoming Nokia products, now reveals that HMD Global is working on a foldable smartphone. The tipped Nokia foldable phone is already in the works and said to launch either by the end of this year or beginning of the next, 2021.

 The report doesn’t reveal any specification details about the upcoming Nokia foldable phone but does suggest that the design will be similar to Motorola Razr. In other words, expect Nokia’s foldable phone to sport a clamshell-like design. Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy Z flip phone is also expected to come with a clamshell like design and won’t look anything like the Galaxy Fold.

 Alongside the foldable phone, HMD Global is also working on the successor of Nokia 9 PureView. The phone is tipped to be called Nokia 9.2. Past reports had said that HMD will delay the launch of the Nokia 9.2 but a new report from Nokiamob suggests that the phone could launch sooner than expected.

 Here’s what HMD is planning for Nokia 9.2

 The Nokia 9.2 is expected to launch in the first half of this year. No specific month for the launch has been revealed for now. The same report reveals that the Nokia 9.2 will be powered by Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 865 processor. This means that this Nokia phone will compete with phones like Samsung Galaxy S20, OnePlus 8, among others.

 The Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) has announced protests across the world after the arrest of its leader Manzoor Pashteen on Monday. According to the PTM, rallies are being organised in countries such as the US, Afghanistan, and Belgium. Besides this, major cities of Pakistan such as Karachi, Islamabad, Quetta, Mardan, Peshawar will also witness protests. On Monday, a local court in Peshawar sent him to judicial custody for 14 days. He has been booked under stringent provisions such as sedition. Meanwhile, section 144 has been imposed in Balochistan ahead of the protests.

 Thousands of Pakistanis gathered in Bannu city of Khyber Pakthunkhwa province on January 12 demanding an end to the atrocities committed by the Pakistani Army. The rally organised by PTM also demonstrated against the Imran Khan-led government. Alleging that the Pakistani Army treated the Pashtuns as third-class citizens, the protesters also revealed that the former indulged in torture and killings. They also pointed out the lack of development in the areas where the Pashtuns lived.

 Occupying the north-western territory of the country, Pashtuns are the second-largest ethnic group in Pakistan, representing approximately 15.42% of the population. Despite having a huge representation in the Pakistani Army, they have consistently suffered discrimination at the hands of the authorities. The killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud, a young Pashtun in Karachi on January 13, 2018, led to the advent of the PTM led by Manzoor Pashteen.

 Since then, the PTM organized massive rallies in major cities of Pakistan such as Lahore, Karachi, Swat, Peshawar, and Quetta seeking justice for the death of innocent Pashtuns. As the ire of the protesters was directed at the Pakistani Army, the latter started propaganda about a foreign conspiracy. Despite the opposition’s charge of massive rigging in the 2019 General Election in Pakistan, the Army was unable to prevent the election of PTM members Mohsin Dawar and Ali Wazir.

 Both the Pakistani government as well as the Army has done everything possible to crush the spirit of the PTM. For instance, parliamentarians Dawar and Wazir were arrested on charges of terrorism after a clash between PTM activists and Army troops at a security post in May 2018. They languished in jail for 4 months before being granted bail.

 This comes a day after Colombo reported its first case of coronavirus, involving a 43-year-old Chinese woman, local media reported.

 The woman, who hails from the Chinese Province of Hubei, had arrived in Sri Lanka as a tourist on January 19, Sudath Samaraweera, the Chief Epidemiologist with the Ministry of Health, said.

 A special committee appointed by the President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to prevent the new coronavirus from spreading in Sri Lanka had proposed temporarily imposing visa restrictions on Chinese tourists.

 The virus originated in Wuhan city of China in December and has since then spread to various cities around the world.

 China has imposed quarantine and travel restrictions, affecting the movement of 56 million people in more than a dozen cities, amid fears that the transmission rate will accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel for the Lunar New Year.

 The death toll from coronavirus in China rose to 106, while 4,515 confirmed cases of the disease have been reported in 30 provincial-level regions by the end of Monday. (ANI)

1119,0,Hindi,abc,"KOLKATA: West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar, who has had frequent run-ins with Mamata Banerjee, tried to call a truce with her and even requested for a seat for his wife in the chief minister’s enclosure at the Republic Day event here which was declined by state authorities over “protocol” issues.

 A highly placed official at the state secretariat said on Monday the government had received a request from the Raj Bhavan to accommodate the first lady in the enclosure meant for the chief minister at the main Republic Day function on the Red Road.

 “There was a request to make arrangements so that the first lady’s seat is near the CM’s. But that could not be entertained due to certain protocol considerations,” the IAS officer told PTI, wishing not to be named.

 The Dhankhars were seen engaged in a brief conversation with Banerjee after the function had ended on Sunday.

 The governor even posted some photographs of him and his wife Sudesh with Banerjee on Twitter.

 “Some glimpses just before leaving the parade for Raj Bhawan. Communication in any form can only lead to affirmative way forward,” Dhankhar had tweeted after the event.

 Later that evening, Banerjee attended the Raj Bhavan ‘At Home’, but cold vibes between them were in evidence again.

 After the national anthem had been played at the beginning of the function, the Dhankhars and Banerjee took their seats at the table, but minutes later the chief minister shifted to a corner surrounded by top state government functionaries and their security detail.

 The ‘At Home’ ended with the playing of the national anthem and Banerjee walked towards Dhankhar.

 As she was about to leave after exchanging pleasantries with him, Dhankhar requested the CM to come over someday for a “dialogue over a cup of tea or coffee”.

 Banerjee smiled broadly and looked at Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha for some time, before leaving the venue without making a commitment.

 “Moments while the Honble Chief Minister is leaving the Reception at Raj Bhawan. While parting indicated to her that we must soon engage in dialogue in larger interest. Hopefully it should mature soon enough,” Dhankhar tweeted.

 He also posted some photographs of the event that showed him and the chief minister together.

 Dhankhar had a brief interaction with Banerjee during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent visit to the city.

 “Had impromptu interaction with Hon’ble Chief Minister yesterday after PM Modi inaugurated sound and light show at Howrah Bridge. Renewed my offer of meeting over a cup of Tea or Coffee,” he had then tweeted.

 Drew McIntyre wasted no time in picking his Wrestlemania 36 opponent and the winner of Mens Royal Rumble announced that he will be challenging Brock Lesnar for the WWE Championship. After the announcement, he was challenged by Karlo Anderson and Luke Gallows to a match. McIntyre picked up a dominant win over the duo. Unsurprisingly, Lesnar came out and attacked McIntyre with an F5. The message was loud and clear from the WWE Champion.

 At Royal Rumble, McIntyre sent Lesnar outside the ring with a Claymore Kick. He went on to make a number of eliminations and confirmed his ticket to Wrestlemanias main event by eliminating Roman Reigns, the one-time Royal Rumble winner.

 WWE Hall of Famer Edge was back on Monday Night Raw as well, where he was attacked by his former tag team partner Randy Orton. They look set to take part in a one-on-one match at Wrestlemania 36.

 Apart from McIntyre, Charlotte Flair was also expected to announce the champion she will be facing at Wrestlemania. Did she announce the name? Lets check that out in the results!

 Rey Mysterio vs MVP - One of the superstars to surprise fans at Royal Rumble, MVP was back on Monday Night Raw too. However, he failed to pick up a win as Mysterio dominated the proceedings. It was MVPs first match on Raw since 2010.

 Aleister Black vs Local talent - Once again, Aleister had to face a local talent and unsurprisingly, he also picked up a win.

 Seth Rollins and Buddy Murphy vs Samoa Joe and Kevin Owens - Participating in his first-ever tag team title match along with Owens, Joe failed to create history as the team Rollins and Murphy retained the championship. During the match, Joe got injured and had to leave the arena, leaving Owens alone.

 Andrade vs Humberto Carrillo - With the United States Championship on the line, Carrillo needed to defeat Andrade via pinfall or submission. He was adjudged as the winner following interference from Zelina Vega but Andrade retained the title as per the rules of the championship match. A rematch is on the cards to take place next week as well.

 Charlotte Flair vs Asuka - Flair, the winner of the womens Royal Rumble, decided against announcing her Wrestlemania opponent but she did participate in an impromptu match against Asuka. The duo came up with a classic match which ended via disqualification with Kairi Sane attacking Flair.

 Mojo Rawley vs No  Way Jose - Rawley took no time in defeating No Way Jose. Following the win, R-Truth pinned Rawley to take off the title but lost it in less than a minute. It seems that Rawley will now keep the title for long.

 Liv Morgan vs Lana - With no Bobby Lashley and Rusev present outside the ring, it was a chance for Morgan to shine and she picked up a win over Lana.

 Erick Rowan vs local talent - No surprises. Rowan again faced a local talent and defeated him with ease. Its a surprise that he doesnt get to face superstars of his size.

 Second-seeded Novak Djokovic might be in red hot form in the ongoing Australian Open 2020, but the Serbian biggest challenge lies ahead as he takes on Canada’s Milos Raonic in the quarter-final at the Rod Laver Arena. While Djokovic has won all the previous nine matches against his big-serving opponent, Raonic has produced many aces to rattle his opponents so far in the tournament.

 Raonic’s serve is undeniably his biggest weapon and it has been once again evident as he hasn’t been broke in the last 12 sets. Raonic has also fired the maximum number of aces so far in Melbourne (82) and also leads the list in terms of first-serve points won (87%).

 ”Hes one of the tallest and strongest guys physically on the Tour. He has one of the biggest serves. Ive got to be ready for missiles coming from his side of the net, Djokovic said anticipating a challenging contest ahead of him. Raonic was out of action for the most part of 2019 but he has made a statement in the tournament by knocking out two quality players in Stephan Tsitsipas and Milos Raonic in his last two matches. Djokovic, who is eyeing an eighth title at the first Grand Slam of the year, might be wary of Raonic and it remains to be seen if he can defuse the ‘missiles’ in the quarters:

1124,0,Tamil ,abc,"NEW DELHI:  Struggling to achieve the revenue target, the Income Tax (I-T) department is planning to intensify its drive against tax defaulters. It will target small businesses and high net worth individuals after big corporate houses suspected of evading taxes.“Last few weeks had been very crucial and we have orders to come down heavily on those who are evading tax, while protecting honest taxpayers. We have a list of 400 small businesses and some high net worth individuals which we will investigate in coming weeks,” a senior official, Income Tax department, told this publication.

 The official claimed that the list of small businesses had been prepared using data analytics by matching invoices from the GST returns. The Income Tax department last week conducted raids on a famous hotel brand and claimed to discover foreign assets of over Rs 1,000 crore and unaccounted domestic assets worth Rs 25 crore. The department also conducted raid on a Chennai-based educational group.

 The officials claimed that they have found unauthorised income worth Rs 7,000 crore in last two months. Direct tax revenues — Corporation Income Tax and Personal Income Tax — together according to the Budget estimate has been pegged at Rs 13.35 lakh crore, which is 16 per cent higher than the Budget estimate (Rs 11.50 lakh crore) and 11.25 per cent higher than the revised estimate (Rs 12 lakh crore).

1125,0,Gujarati,xyz,"PUNE: The Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) new Commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, on Monday, tabled a Rs 6,229-crore budget for the financial year 2020-21. the budget proposes a 12 per cent property tax hike. No new development projects have been included, instead the commissioner hinted that non-viable projects will be scrapped. He also hinted at introduction of ownership of dams and dedicated freeway for two-wheelers.

 Gaikwad is the only civic chief to have presented the PMC annual budget barely six days after he took charge as the commissioner on January 22. Understandably, he did not get time to introduce new schemes or projects. However, he hinted at some initiatives during the budget briefing.

 LESS THAN 2019-20 Though it was Gaikwad who presented the budget to the Standing Committee on Monday, it was the previous commissioner Saurabh Rao, who had prepared it. In this Rao-drafted budget, the civic chief has proposed a hike of 12 per cent in property tax and 15 per cent in water tax.

 This budget is Rs 506 crore less as compared to last years’ Standing Committee budget of Rs 6,765 crore and Rs 144 crore more than PMC commissioner’s budget of Rs 6,085 crore.

 There is a Rs 1,500-crore deficit as the administration has failed to achieve revenue collection target.

 NECESSITY OF SUPPLEMENTARY BUDGET “The common man is my priority and the civic body would make a budget considering that. I have decided to make a mid-term review of the budget. I will make a supplementary budget to stabilise public money by taking steps in bringing income and expenditure in line. It will be drafted in December and will clear the picture of the utilisation of funds. This concept is practised in State assembly. PMC will be the first to introduce it at the corporation level,” Gaikwad said.

 TO BOOST REVENUE Gaikwad said, “For boosting revenue, the PMC has developed new software to generate property tax collection. The software will add new properties after they will get the ‘Occupancy Certificate’ from the PMC. Right now, the process is lengthy and time-consuming. Commercial utilisation of PMPML depots is another option to increase revenue.”

 For better transportation and solve the traffic problem, Gaikwad said, “We will check the option to introduce electrical and solar buses in Peth areas with the help of CSR Funds.

 LONG-TERM PLANNING The civic chief said, “We haven’t introduced any new projects. But, we have decided to review the existing development projects and table report of existing projects’ viability to the Standing Committee so that committee can decide whether those are beneficial for citizens and worth spending taxpayers’ money. We have to make long-term planning like 50 years to make citizens lives better.”

 BUDGET HIGHLIGHTS - Supplementary budget - Bhabha Atomic Research Centre technology-based treatment of sewage - Outsource cleaning public toilets - 210 new electric buses on the public-private partnership (PPP) model - Bund Garden to Mundhwa elevated road on PPP model - Road stabilisation technique for road development

1126,0,Tamil ,xyz,"PUNE: Healthcare industry has demanded tax exemption to make healthcare more affordable ahead of the Union Budget. Also, experts have demanded larger allotment for Ayushman Bharat to cover more people under its ambit.

 BURDEN OF NCDS Amol Naikawadi, Joint Managing Director, Indus Health Plus, said that non communicable diseases (NCDs) have become a healthcare priority in India. “We have observed that the pattern of NCDs in rural India appears to be largely similar to that in urban India,” Naikawadi said.

 “Hence, it has become crucial to encourage Indian population to go for regular screening for early diagnosis of NCDs. Early detection and timely treatment can be helpful in reducing the overall burden of the last stage treatment expenses. In addition, we have seen a potential in new technologies like genetic testing for diagnosis in terms of how it can help in knowing the predisposition of various NCDs so that people can take necessary steps to control them. Besides, it can contribute in personalising the health and wellness aspects for an individual, thereby reducing the curative costs. We strongly recommend increasing the tax exemption limit on preventive health checkup including genetic testing under section 80D to Rs 20,000 per person annually. This will encourage people to go for regular health screening and help us make India a ‘Healthy India’,” he said.

 He also added there is a need to bring in Zero-rating GST on healthcare services, as it would reduce the cost of healthcare providers. As a result of this, the benefit will be passed on to the end consumers, which will lower the overall medical care costs.”

 TAX EXEMPTION Echoing similar sentiments, Nickhil Jakatdar, CEO, GenePath, said that molecular diagnostics and genetic testing for preventive screening of cervical, breast and ovarian as well as prostate cancer is known to be significantly more accurate than regular tests and are routinely used in the developed world.

 “However the higher costs of these tests dissuade doctors in India from prescribing them to the layman, while the lack of scale inhibits research and development activity to come up with lower cost and South Asian genome relevant tests. If the tax exemption on preventive health check-ups is raised from current Rs. 5,000 to Rs. 20,000 under section 80D of the Income Tax Act, it will significantly accelerate the adoption of a better level of healthcare in the country,” said Jakatdar.

 Suresh Vazirani, Chairman and Managing Director, Transasia-Erba group, said that the industry looks forward to crucial government reforms that will help achieve these numbers.

 “To start with, the revision in GST rates requires immediate attention. Providing free healthcare to every citizen of India is the Government’s constitutional responsibility. It needs to focus on reducing medical expenditure burden on general public, which currently bears almost 70 per cent of all medical expenditures. While the government has exempted the healthcare services from GST, the taxation on the medical supplies and devices, ultimately is a hindrance in bringing down the cost of treatment,” said Vazirani.

 AYUSHMAN BHARAT MUST REACH ALL Dr GSK Velu, Chairman and Managing Director, Neuberg Diagnostics Private Limited, said that higher allotment for health sector will help schemes like Ayushman Bharat to reach a larger section of the population with measurable outcome.

 INCREASE IN HEALTHCARE BUDGET Meena Ganesh, MD and CEO, Portea Medical, India’s leading consumer healthcare brand, said that India has one of the lowest spending on healthcare globally.

 “While it was stated that the country is set to increase healthcare spending to 2.5 per cent of the GDP by 2025, it continues to stand at 1 per cent. We hope to see some action around this in the upcoming budget. A major focus must be given to the home healthcare industry, which is one of the ways to realise the government’s vision of affordable healthcare for all. However, current taxation policies and regulations do not cover home healthcare and diagnostic tests and other at-home aspects still form a large part of people’s out of pocket expenses. Home healthcare is not recognised as a mainstream sector and should be brought under the ambit of governmental schemes like the Ayushman Bharat yojana. We also expect to see an increase in the limits on reimbursement of expenses on diagnostics, preventive health check-ups, etc, and for home healthcare to be made a part of this exemption. Critical healthcare equipment such as ventilators, wheelchairs, crutches, and medical equipment spare parts should be exempted from GST. This will help make quality healthcare more accessible,” said Meena Ganesh.

 Melbourne, January 28: Ashleigh Barty will play 14th-seeded American Sofia Kenin in the Australian Open semi-finals after the world number one defeated Petra Kvitova in straight sets on Tuesday.

 The top seed and last remaining Australian in the tournament survived a tough opening set to beat the Czech seventh seed 7-6 (8/6), 6-2 and reach the semi-finals for the first time.

 This was revenge for the 23-year-old Barty after two-time Wimbledon champion Kvitova beat her at the same stage last year in Melbourne. But the down-to-earth Australian is a better player than 12 months ago, winning the French Open last year and hitting the top of the rankings for the first time.

 Its been absolutely incredible. I knew that I had to bring my best today against Petra, and that first set was crucial, said Barty.

 Barty is attempting to become the first Australian woman since Chris ONeil in 1978 win the womens title Down Under. Kvitova, 29, who suffered severe injury to her left playing hand in a knife attack at her home in 2016, and Barty went toe-to-toe in a crucial seventh game of the first set.

 In a game stretching to nearly 10 minutes, Barty fought off five break points to hold serve at Rod Laver Arena, to roars of approval. In a tense encounter they went to the tie-break, but it was Kvitova who blinked, shanking a forehand long to give Barty the set in 69 high-quality minutes.

 Barty, who once gave up tennis to play professional cricket, clenched her fist. Kvitova tossed her racquet into air. Barty pulled away in the second set as Kvitova wilted in the Melbourne sun. The Australian sealed the deal with her trademark minimum fuss, booking her spot in the last four with an ace.

 Earlier Kenin, Coco Gauffs conqueror, reached her first Major semi-final as the American ended the historic run of Tunisian Ons Jabeur. The Moscow-born 21-year-old, who defeated 15-year-old Gauff in the previous round, saw off the unseeded Jabeur 6-4, 6-4 and said that she was super-excited.

 It was a tough match, said Kenin, who moved to New York as a baby with her family with just a few hundred dollars to their name.

 Kenin said that holding her serve at 3-2 down in the second set, in a game that stretched to 10 minutes, was a turning point.

 It was a tough moment, she was playing well. I didnt know it was 10 minutes but it felt pretty long, she said.

 But after that I got my momentum and started playing better. The 78th-ranked Jabeur was the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final.

The Avast antivirus programme was installed on a persons computer which collected the data, and Jumpshot repackaged it into various different products which were sold to big companies.

 Potential clients include Google, Yelp, Microsoft, McKinsey, Pepsi, Sephora, Home Depot, Conde Nast, Intuit, and many others, the report claimed.

 In a statement, Avast said it has stopped providing browsing data collected by the extensions to Jumpshot. Some clients even paid millions of dollars for products that include a so-called All Clicks Feed, which can track user behaviour, clicks, and movement across websites in detail. In copies of contracts with Jumpshot clients, one marketing firm paid over $2 million for data access last year.

 Avast offers a selection of free and paid-for antivirus and security tools, in both free and in paid-for formats. According to the investigation, Avast also recorded porn site visits that are anonymized, offered the date and time the user visited the sites, as well as search terms and viewed videos in some instances.

 Multiple Avast users told Motherboard they were not aware that Avast sold browsing data, raising questions about how informed that consent is. The investigation also that Avast is still harvesting the data, but via the anti-virus software itself, rather than the browser plugins.

 After crushing Scotland U-19s in their final group stage match, Zimbabwe U-19s will look to continue their fine form when they meet minnows Canada U-19s in the third quarterfinal of the U-19 World Cup 2020 Plate League. Zimbabwe U-19s did not have the finest of starts to their campaign but the African youngsters brought their A game to the table versus the Scots.

 This match between Zimbabwe U-19s and Scotland U-19s will start at 1:30 PM IST with the venue for the game being the North-West University Ground No.2 of Potchefstroom.

 Canada U-19s struggled to get going in the first round but they have an opportunity to turn things around and attain a higher rank in the Plate League. The Canadians lost their matches against U.A.E. U-19s and South Africa U-19s while their match against Afghanistan U-19s produced no result.

 The rainy conditions in Potchefstroom may tempt both the skippers to have a bowl first. Zimbabwean skipper Dion Myers will hope that Sakhumuzi Ndlela carries on his good form from the match against Scotland U-19s. The upcoming bowler had scalped 4 wickets in that game.

 On the other side, Canada U-19s will rest their hopes on the duo of Akhil Kumar and Benjamin Calitz. Kumar had troubled the Proteas players with the ball while Calitz scored a fighting half-century in that fixture.

1131,0,English,abc,"A Doctor Explains Why We Have to Stop Popping Antibiotics

 SHARE, SAVE, COMMENT

 As a physician, it takes me a mere 10 seconds to prescribe an antibiotic. However, it can take more than 10 minutes for me to explain to a patient how to take the antibiotic correctly or why an antibiotic is not required for a specific infection. I believe this is vital if we are to curb the spread of one our biggest global healthcare nightmares: antibiotic resistance. It is the overuse and underuse of antibiotics that has fuelled this phenomenon of antibiotic resistance, which is when bacteria change their characteristics so that a drug no longer works on them.

 Most people know that antibiotics are powerful, lifesaving medicines that are effective against several infections. Almost everyone will be prescribed an antibiotic course at some point in their life, which makes it just as important for everyone to know the right way to take (or not take!) antibiotics. Here are three things you must know:

 Different antibiotics work in different ways, but they all accomplish one singular task: they kill bacteria. They are not effective against viruses that are often responsible for everyday illnesses such as the common cold and flu. People with a good immune system are able to fight off non-serious viral infections without any medication, which makes taking an antibiotic completely unnecessary.

 Antibiotics should be given only for bacterial infections. In a few cases, when people who are immunocompromised (that is, they have a weak immune system) get a viral infection, they may be prescribed an antibiotic to prevent a secondary bacterial infection.

 You Must Complete the Prescribed Course of Antibiotics

 All antibiotics must be taken according to a prescribed schedule, in terms of their frequency, dosage and duration of treatment. Since most antibiotics start combating an infection soon after they are taken, people start to feel better even before they have completed their treatment. It is vital for patients to finish their whole course of treatment. If not, the bacteria that survive the shortened course of antibiotics have time to ‘recover’, multiply and resist any subsequent treatment with the same drug. Completing an antibiotic course therefore helps to prevent a recurrence of the infection and the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria.

 Many people use an old prescription to buy more antibiotics if they develop the same infection again. Or they share their unused ‘leftover drugs’ with someone else who may seem to have a similar infection. Both these practices are wrong and contribute to the menace of antibiotic resistance.

 Only a doctor can decide whether the new infection is a bacterial or a viral one, and then recommend the right treatment, which may or may not include antibiotics. The doctor is also aware of infections that may be prevalent in the area at any particular time, example the seasonal flu, and is therefore in a better position to prescribe the right treatment.

 Taking antibiotics when not needed may not only kill the good microbes in your body but also promote the growth of resistant bacteria.

 I would like to make the Indian public fully understand how to consume antibiotics the right way. Each one of us must play our part in curbing antibiotic resistance and encourage others to do the same. Antibiotics are ‘friends’ and lifesavers, but our continued misuse is beginning to make them an ‘enemy’ by fuelling the problem of antibiotic resistance. This can cause us to lose one of our best weapons in the fight against infectious diseases. We do not have many new antibiotics in the pipeline, so it is imperative that we do our best to ensure that the antibiotics we have are effective for generations to come. Or we may go back into an era when even a common Strep throat infection could turn deadly.

1132,0,Telugu,pqr,"Colombo : Sri Lankan authorities have confirmed the first case of novel coronavirus after a Chinese woman was diagnosed with the disease, making the island nation the second South Asian country after Nepal to report a confirmed case.

 On Monday night, the Health Promotion Bureau said that the woman was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) and was confirmed to have been infected during treatment, reports the Daily Financial Times.

 The Health Ministry has assured that all steps have been taken to contain the infection, and called on the public not to panic.

 The Chinese woman was reported to have come from China’s Hubei province, where the outbreak originated in its capital city of Wuhan.

 News of the first case, triggered panic-buying of surgical masks with many pharmacies across Sri Lanka running out of supplies by Monday.

 In South Asia, Nepal has reported one confirmed case, Pakistan has five suspected cases, while there has been no confirmations from India and Bangladesh so far.

 As of Tuesday, 106 people died due to the coronavirus in China, with 4,515 confirmed cases in 30 provincial-level regions.

 Other countries with confirmed cases outside of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau include Germany, Cambodia, Thailand, Australia, Singapore, the US, Japan, Malaysia, South Korea, France, Vietnam, Canada and Ivory Coast.

 No deaths have been reported outside of China.

 The symptoms of the new coronavirus are similar to those of cold but may be accompanied by fever and fatigue, dry cough and dyspnea (shortness of breath).

 The WHO is yet to declare the outbreak as a global epidemic.

 Sri Lanka suspended its policy of granting visa on arrival for Chinese travellers on Tuesday, 28 January, a day after the health authorities detected the countrys first coronavirus infection.

 Sudath Suraweera, the chief epidemiologist of the countrys health ministry, said on Monday, 27 January that a 40-year-old Chinese woman was found positive for the virus.

 “She arrived on 19 January and was tested positive for the virus when she was leaving the airport on 25 January. She was admitted to the infectious diseases hospital.”

 Sudath Suraweera, Chief Epidemiologist, Health Ministry, Sri Lanka

 Following the first detection of the coronavirus case, the Sri Lankan health authorities ordered the suspension of the on arrival visa policy for the Chinese nationals.

 Travellers from China must apply for visa via the online portal, the authorities said.

 The officials at Colombo international airport said the entry to airports arrival and departure terminals had been restricted to passengers only.

 Some 65 Sri Lankan students in China returned by Monday. Another flight to evacuate students is due to leave on Tuesday. A total of 204 students have been evacuated in the last three days.

 The government has said that it has completed the collection of information on students in China. A National Action Committee to prevent the spreading of coronavirus was convened on Monday. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa appointed the committee comprising health experts.

 The death toll in Chinas deadly coronavirus epidemic has crossed the 100 mark while the confirmed cases have gone up to 4200.

 In April last year, Sri Lanka suspended its plans to grant visas on arrival for citizens of 39 countries after the devastating Easter suicide bombings that killed nearly 360 people.

 KTM has teased the 2020 390 Duke on its social media handles, sharing information about a key new feature on the naked streetfighter. The new 390 Duke will now come with a quickshifter (Quickshifter+) as standard, making it the only bike in its category to get this feature. Equipping the bike with a bi-directional quickshifter makes sense as the feature is already available on 390 Adventure, formers ADV cousin that was launched in India this month. Besides this, the upcoming motorcycle will also get a handful of cosmetic tweaks and a BS 6-compliant engine. We expect the new KTM 390 Dukes India launch to take place soon, probably next month.

 The company is unlikely to introduce any radical changes to 390 Dukes design in order to keep the price hike minimal. So, the bike will sport the same sharp styling with mass-forward stance and compact dimensions. However, in its new iteration, it will probably get new colour options.

 2020 KTM 390 Duke is already quite feature-loaded as compared to its rivals. It gets a 4.3-inch coloured TFT instrument panel which offers readouts for all the necessary information. This console also gets KTM MY RIDE feature for smartphone connectivity. With that being said, the bike is likely to miss out on getting additional features like cornering ABS and traction control system, both of which are standard on the 390 Adventure.

 2020 KTM 390 Duke will be powered by the same engine which propels 390 Adventure i.e. a BS 6-compliant 373.2 cc liquid-cooled, single-cylinder engine that delivers 43 bhp and 37 Nm. It will continue to be offered in combination with a six-speed gearbox but will also get Quickshifter+ as standard for smoother gearshifts. However, there is a possibility that the quickshifter could work only above 2,000 rpm, just like it does on the KTM adventure bike.

 Of course, the new 390 Duke will be expensive than the existing model on account of the BS 6 engine and Quickshifter+. So, while the current model costs ₹2.48 lakh, the new KTM 390 Dukes price could range between ₹2.58 lakh to ₹2.6 lakh. All prices are ex-showroom.

 About 45 Indian medical students at Jianghan University School of Medicine in Wuhan, who are stranded in their hostels after the novel coronavirus outbreak, are seeking immediate help from Indian authorities. The outbreak has already killed over 80 people in China.

 Vishal P, a third-year student, told The Indian Express that they are surviving on limited provisions as the canteens have shut down. He said 45-odd Indian students are waiting for help from the embassy. “The problems started on January 1 with the detection of the first case. Authorities imposed a lockdown in the city last Thursday. Many students I know who are from the US, France, Jordan and Sudan have left China on chartered flights arranged by their countries. We are yet to get a solid reply from the embassy even after we spoke to them and sent many alerts,” he said.

 “Whenever we call them, they reply they are in a meeting. They keep asking us to take precautions while we expect them to help us with a flight back. Only Indian students and a few African and Pakistani students are left in the hostel. All other foreign students have been relocated by their embassies,” he said.

 A student from Rajasthan said they are “vulnerable” because the main hospitals treating the novel coronavirus are close to their campus.

 Another student, Krishna Murthy from Chennai, said they had to visit the local market on Sunday after they ran out of food provisions. “Only one of the four canteens in the hostel is currently functional… we had to get provisions and cook. We totally understand the strict restrictions imposed by Chinese authorities. But we hope Indian authorities take immediate steps to rescue us like other countries did for their students,” he said.

 Murthy said their classes were suspended on January 10 for holidays. “Out of some 75 Indian students, only few went home. No cases have been reported from our university, but we are vulnerable as we have to move out, visit markets to buy vegetables and other provisions at least once a week,” he said.

 The Indian Embassy in Beijing on Monday issued an alert, seeking information about Indians facing shortage of food, water and other essentials. “…provide us with the exact location so that the Embassy in Beijing could work with the Chinese authorities to ensure that such essential supplies are sustained,” said a statement from the embassy.

 The Royal Rumble was a success across many departments and in case you were wondering if WWE was able to carry the momentum to RAW, youre partly right. The show was a superb affair in some respects and in some others, it was not nearly as good.

 I loved the beginning and the end and certain parts in the middle for sure. I am still yet to feel the excitement that accompanies WrestleMania season yet but Im guessing I will start to feel it as we inch closer to the show.

 Be sure to leave a comment and share your thoughts about the show in the comments section below, ladies, and gentlemen. I would love to hear your take and get your opinion with regard to how you felt the show was!

 In any case, here is the best and worst of WWE RAW, the fallout edition following the Royal Rumble!

 There are a variety of reasons regarding why Randy Orton is a heel again and I shall detail them all in a subsequent article. But I honestly loved Edges promo to close out the show and the fact that Randy Orton teased a reunion of the old tag team before he showed his true colors and took his frustrations out on Edges neck.

 Personally, I love Randy Orton in this avatar because he is a natural heel just like Seth Rollins is. Something about him just screams that hes not the good guy even when he is playing one, and I was glad to see him tap into the darker side of his persona to close out this weeks edition of WWE RAW, as the crowd gaped in shock.

 The Viper has struck and the world would never be the same again.

In 2020, China will embrace more domestically-developed civil airplane models, as a result of persistent efforts in developing the two trunk and two regional aircraft projects, namely C919 narrowbody and CR929 widebody trunk aircraft and the Modern Ark series and ARJ21 regional planes.

 Continuing to hold the position of the worlds second-largest civil aviation market, China continuously generates power from independent development and contributes to the world with a booming market to share.

 MA700 to conduct maiden flight

 Chinas MA700 aircraft is set to fly into the sky in 2020, becoming the third member of the domestically-developed Modern Ark regional turboprop airplane family, according to its developer.

 The MA700 project has entered the final assembly phase. Assembly work for both the maiden flight and static tests are underway, said the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC).

 The first MA700 airplane is scheduled to roll off the production line in mid-2020, and the maiden flight is expected to take place within the year, AVIC told Xinhua.

 The 70-seat new turboprop aircraft model highlights the performance in short- and medium-haul markets, with an aim to serve the countrys booming air traffic demand.

 The MA700 is the third member of Chinas domestically-developed Modern Ark (MA) regional turboprop airplane family, which is developed by AVIC XAC Commercial Aircraft Co., Ltd. in Xian, northwest Chinas Shaanxi Province. This turboprop airplane family is a part of Chinas commitment to boost its capacity in developing civil airplanes through major projects of the two trunk and two regional aircraft.

 The Modern Ark family now has two members, the MA60 and MA600. To date, a total of 109 MA60 and MA600 airplanes have been delivered to customers.

 As an upgraded version, the MA700 will be capable to serve for operators in complicated operating environments, such as Chinas vast western regions with extreme temperatures, plateaus and mountains.

1143,0,English,xyz,"Seven-time Grand Slam winner Mats Wilander has urged Nick Kyrgios to play more matches on the Australian Open’s centre court if he’s serious about winning his home Grand Slam.

 Wilander said the Australian needs to get used to playing at Rod Laver Arena, rather than sticking to his favoured Melbourne Arena, a smaller but rowdier venue.

 Kyrgios played his first three matches at Melbourne Arena but then lost to world number one Rafael Nadal at Rod Laver Arena late Monday, going down in four sets.

 “Something that goes along with being a great player is setting yourself up for failure or success,” Wilander told AFP.

 “So if you set yourself up for playing those matches on Melbourne Arena because that’s where you think you have the best chance to win, you’re clearly not thinking about winning the tournament, nor is the tournament organisation.”

 Also read: Kyrgios, Medvedev can only learn from close losses to veterans Nadal, Wawrinka

 Kyrgios, with his booming serve and flamboyant nature, is one of tennis’s greatest talents but in seven trips to Melbourne Park, his best result is reaching the quarter-finals in 2015.

 It’s a pattern repeated elsewhere as the 24-year-old, so often hampered by his volatile temper, has only reached one other Grand Slam quarter-final, at Wimbledon in 2015.

 Kyrgios, who was handed a 16-week suspended ban in September, has cut a notably calmer figure in Melbourne but he always looked second-favourite against Nadal.

 “He comes in here (Rod Laver Arena) and he gets neutralised and he gets stale and he gets tired,” Wilander said.

 “Emotionally it’s too draining to suddenly not have the crowd behind you and play for you only when you don’t get applause for drop shots or tweeners or ace on second serve.

 “You’re not setting yourself up as one of the guys that believe they can win.”

 Wilander said Kyrgios is a “breath of fresh air, brilliant tennis player”.

 “I would love to see Nick Kyrgios turn it on and be one of the best players in the world. But there’s a lot more that you have to do to be considered one of them,” said the Swede.

 He added: “I have no feeling for Nick Kyrgios until he wins a tennis match where not everybody is rooting for him, and it’s 50-50, and it’s one of the best players in the world, and he goes through the whole match, wins it and backs it up the next day.

1145,0,Hindi,pqr,"A gay couple has moved the Kerala High Court, seeking to strike down certain provisions under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, which do not permit to get their marriage registered. Considering the writ petition by the petitioners on Monday, the court has sought the views of Central and state governments on the matter.

 The petitioners, a business man and an IT professional had met each other in May 2018 and fallen in love. After being in a relationship for two months, they decided to get hitched. In September last year, they got married in a private ceremony.

 However, the religious authorities declined to solemnise the wedding and hence the couple decided to get their marriage registered under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, which does not recognise homosexual marriages.

 In their plea, the gay couple stated thatit was aggrieved by the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 whereby the law provided therein only permits a heterosexual (opposite sex) couple to get married and a homosexual couple like them is denied equal access to the institution of marriage.

 They claim that the impugned provisions of the Act violate their fundamental rights and are thus illegal and unconstitutional to that extent. Seeking declarations in this connection and to obtain the relief for getting married under the Act, the writ petition was being moved jointly by the petitioners, who submitted that they have suffered public humiliation after they disclosed their love for each other.

 But, greater is the insult and indignity the petitioners have suffered at the hands of law, which refuses to recognise their union, causing immense pain and agony to them, they said in the petition.

 Noting that the impugned provisions restrict the process of application, solemnisation and registration of marriages to heterosexual couples alone and exclude homosexual couples from its ambit, thepetitioners said it must be held unconstitutional and thus be struck or read down to that extent of illegality.

1147,0,English,abc,"Among the snapshots of the unique protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) at Shaheen Bagh in Delhi and other places were those of not just women and children on the streets. It was the picture of a self-styled Dalit leader on the footsteps of the imposing Jama Masjid near the Red Fort, symbolising yet another attempt to create a narrative of ‘Dalit-Muslim unity’.

 On focus was the so-called Bhim Army and its chief Chandrashekhar Azad ‘Ravan’ who escaped detention first when violence broke out in Daryaganj areas and later showed up at the anti-CAA protest and turned himself in to the police. The drama added to his growing persona as the new face of the Dalit movement in the Hindi heartland.

 After being detained in TIhar jail for more than three weeks, Azad was granted bail. Following this he participated in anti-CAA protests at the Jama Masjid and at Shaheen Bagh, signalling that he was heralding a new course among the Dalits and the Muslims in opposing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

 On January 20, standing on the stone steps of the 17th century mosque Azad read out of the Constitution’s Preamble to the huge crowds and vowed to carry on the fight against the CAA on behalf of the Muslims. Those impressed by his words even saw a new ‘imam’ in him outclassing Jama Masjid’s official Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari who had defended the CAA.

 Azad’s next stop was the protest site at Shaheen Bagh, where protesters, mainly women and children, have been on a month-long sit-in protest blocking an arterial road connecting south Delhi with Faridabad and Noida in Uttar Pradesh. There, Azad said, “in the next 10 days, there will be at least 5,000 Shaheen Baghs across the country. Till the Bhim Army is here, this law would not be applicable and they have to go through my corpse (to implement it).”

 Of course, for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress, Azad’s shows have meant more support for them among the Dalits and the Muslims against Modi ahead of the Delhi polls on February 8. However, this is unlikely to pose a big danger to the BJP as there could not be additional loss of votes on this account. Besides, polarisation cuts both ways.

 As things stand today, Azad is a political novelty who is bound to make waves. For those working on a pan-India unity of the Dalits and the Muslims, Azad is someone who will take head-on the BJP’s Hindu vs Muslim binary. They believe Azad has the potential in him to encroach upon the BJP vote-bank, especially among the Dalits though there is not enough evidence in this regard now.

 Perhaps, Azad could develop the capacity to eventually throw a spanner at the BJP’s plans to work among the Dalits with initiatives such as the Ambedkar Navodaya Schools, etc. across India.

 Significantly, the idea of Dalit-Muslim unity has been talked about for a long time. Its proponents have held that both the Dalits and the Muslims could switch votes from one party to another forming a bloc of voters whose needs cannot be ignored. Of late, All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM)’s Asaduddin Owaisi has been trying to make this work. Keen to replace the influence of the so-called secular parties, Owaisi has been organising conferences to bring the Dalits and the Muslims together in areas where the Muslims dominate but need the Dalits to win assembly or Lok Sabha seats.

 Many feel that at the height of her popularity Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati symbolised this unity. Then, Muslims leaders were often seen in the company of emerging Dalit leaders from the BSP in Uttar Pradesh.

 With her decline, new Dalit icons, like Azad, hold out hope for the Muslims. In fact, in the AIMIM’s slogan ‘Jai Bhim, Jai Meem’, Bhim stands for Babasaheb Ambedkar and Meem is the Urdu alphabet ‘M’ for Muslim.

 Owaisi, who saw some success with Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) in Maharashtra, hopes a similar alliance with the Dalit parties and the Bhim Army can come up in Bihar. On December 29, Owaisi addressed a gathering of more than 50,000 people in Bihar’s Kishanganj. Back in 2015, he had pledged his resources for Dalit groups to hold protests at several places when the row over Rohith Vemula, the deceased student of University of Hyderabad, erupted all over India.

 Vemula’s photographs recently surfaced as a face of the anti-CAA protest in an indication of attempts to forge Dalti-Muslim unity. On January 26, the tricolour was hoisted at the Shaheen Bagh by Vemula’s mother, who was accompanied by the grandmothers of Shaheen Bagh and former JNU student Umar Khalid.

 Irrespective of whether the Saharanpur-born Azad emerges as the next big Dalit leader to replace the likes of Mayawati, the sight of a ‘low caste’ Hindu sporting moustache and riding an Enfield Bullet inspires hope for Muslims leaders who are looking for new ways to jinx the BJP.

 Last week, spot gold rose by 0.2 percent as worries over a new coronavirus in the major Chinese cities further boosted the appeal for the safe haven asset. The coronavirus outbreak in China led to about 25 deaths and the reported cases of infection confirmed were over 830. The markets expect that newly found virus which has spread in various nations might impact the global economy which boosted the demand for the safe haven asset, Gold. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) didn’t feel the urge to declare a global emergency over the virus outbreak which limited the uptrend in prices. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that the fresh trade deals with China, Mexico and Canada could help the U.S. economy and helped the U.S. Dollar recover in turn pressurizing the yellow metal prices. China’s consumption of the precious metal dipped for the first time in three year in 2019 reflecting from the high Gold prices and an economic slowdown in the Chinese economy.

 The stagnating Indian economy is at the verge of stagflation and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government is in a denial mode, according to the Congress.Addressing the media at the party headquarters, here on Monday, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said, 2020 holds little promise given the precarious state of the economy with the gross domestic product (GDP) growth below 6 per cent and inflation around 7.5 per cent. The time for empty talks is over..She said the Union Budget for 2020-21 was being presented at a time when the economy was deep into a slowdown.The consequences of stagflation are precarious. It will stoke inflation higher, deepen the slowdown, stall investments that are at 27 per cent of the GDP and erode jobs, Shrinate said. As per the data, 3.4 crore jobs across seven main economic sectors were lost in the last five years, she added.It would aggravate the acute rural stress and further dampen consumption, she said.This vicious cycle of downward economic spiral is worrisome, she said. Because the government continued to be in denial, slowly what was essentially a demand problem was turning into a supply issue as well. The Indian economy can ill afford this double whammy, the Congress leader said.The drop in direct tax revenue for the first time in 20 years makes the fiscal situation precarious. Its a sign of wage loss and joblessness. Possibilities of 4.5 per cent plus fiscal deficit by March 31 loom large. The under-5-per-cent-growth will make the deficit even larger, she said.Stating that the credit rating agencies have repeatedly red flagged fiscal discipline, the Congress spokesperson said, Letting go of fiscal discipline will make them cut sovereign rating below investment rate. Experts fear hundreds of billions of dollars will flow out of Indian markets. After all shareholders dont allow investments below a certain grade. Higher fiscal deficit will also push inflation higher.Only thing consistent about this government was the deteriorating quality of budgets over six years, she said.We sincerely hope the budget will have thought-through proposals and not the half-baked ones, to be rolled back one after the another like the last year.

 Reliance Jio has become the largest telecom player by revenue and subscriber base, India Ratings said on Monday.Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd has remained aggressive in subscriber acquisition and has become the largest player in terms of wireless subscriber market share, broadband subscriber base and revenue, it said.The increase in RJios subscriber base is largely at the cost of Vodafone Idea Ltd, whose subscriber market share has declined consistently in last two years.Revenue market share of RJios also grew to 34.9 per cent in 2QFY20, which is the highest in the industry compared to other players, the agency said.India Ratings also said that the industry is showing signs of recovery.The average revenue per user (ARPU) reported by telecom companies has started showing signs of recovery in the last two to three quarters. Moreover, the recent tariff hikes by telcos in the range of 25 per cent to 35 per cent is likely to support the increase in ARPU over the next few quarters. Furthermore, the share of broadband subscribers in the overall subscriber base is on a continuous rise.The rising share of data subscribers along with growing data traffic and stabilising data tariffs augurs well for revenue growth in our view, it said.It also said that the release of a consultation paper by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) in December 2019 to evaluate setting a floor price for telecom tariffs is a positive move for the telecom industry in its view. Additionally, some sense of relief to the telcos was also provided by the extension of the implementation of zero interconnect usage charge regime by a year, the agency said.TRAI has extended levy of INR0.06/minute till December 2020 from December 2019 earlier. As a result, the effective date of implementation of the regime has been postponed to January 1, 2021.Indian Ratings has downgraded VILs long-term issuer rating to IND BBB- from IND BBB while maintaining it on rating watch negative. The downgrade reflects the crystallisation of adjusted gross revenue related liabilities for VIL post the Supreme Courts adverse ruling on January 16, dismissing the review petition filed by telcos.

 Fuel prices in India were lowered for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday as international oil rates continued to slide over fears of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

 Petrol prices per litre were cut by 11 paise to Rs 73.60 in New Delhi, Rs 76.22 in Kolkata, Rs 79.21 in Mumbai and Rs 76.44 in Chennai. Diesel prices per litre were reduced by 13 paise to Rs 66.58 in New Delhi, Rs 68.94 in Kolkata, Rs 69.79 in Mumbai and Rs 70.33 in Chennai.

 International oil benchmark Brent crude was down by 0.3 percent to $59.17 per barrel on Tuesday. On Monday, the index had slipped to its lowest in three months to $58.50.

 Fuel prices in India are based on international oil price movements and rupees exchange rate.

 Chinese health authorities said that the coronavirus outbreak has killed 106 people and infected 4,515 raising fears across the globe. Countries, including the US, have issued warnings against travel to China, leaving millions of travellers stranded at the biggest holiday in the Chinese calendar.

 Investors in oil are concerned that travel restrictions and fall in economic growth will dampen demand for crude and its products while supply remains high.

 There are concerns that spread of infection, transportation disruptions, cancellation of group tours from China and an extension in the Lunar Holiday will likely hurt the global economy. If the situation takes longer to subside, it will hurt exports, output and corporate profits of companies that are impacted by production and consumption in China.

 Even as the markets continue to remain just 2 per cent below their historic lows, there are many good quality stocks that have dived to 52-week lows. Here are a few of them:

 ONGC

 Indias largest oil and gas exploration company is trading at Rs 116.80, which is just 1 per cent away from its 52-week low of Rs 115.55.

 A fall in crude prices has pushed the stock lower. Moreover, divestment of stake sale in the company may also be an overhang on the stock. However, at these levels the stock is trading at a 1-year forward p/e of just 5 times, which is almost half of the valuations when compared to global peers.

 At the current price of Rs 116.40, the stock yields a dividend of more than 6 per cent, which is not bad at all.

 Oil India

 Oil India is another oil and gas exploration company like ONGC, which is just 1 per cent lower than its 52-week low price of Rs 137.

 Again, the stock at the current market price of Rs 138.70, gives a good dividend yield of 7.30 per cent. If both these companies increase their dividends, the dividend yield is significanly higher.

 Hindustan Zinc

 Indias largest Zinc and silver producer has seen its share price drop to Rs 200, which is just three per cent away from a 52-week low. There were hopes that the board would declare dividends at the last board meeting when quarterly numbers were declared.

 However, that did not happen. The stock would remain a good bet for its dividend yields.

 Indian oil Corporation

 This is another stock that is just 3 per cent away from its 52-week low and is currently trading at Rs 117.40. Government owned oil marketing company stocks and those from the oil exploration business have both seen their share prices drop.

 One reason for the same could be the divestment. However, most of these stocks do offer value.

 Marico

 FMCG major Marico, is a stock that is just 4 per cent away from its 52-week lows. The stock is trading at Rs 339, against its 52-week low of Rs 324. FMCG stocks have been hurt on account of the economic slowdown. Some of these stocks could be a good bets for the long-term. If some of the PSU stocks declare good dividends, they would be ideal, given that dividends are tax free in the hands of investors up to a sum of Rs 10 lakhs.

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP Parvesh Verma, on Monday, said that Shaheen Bagh will be vacated within an hour’s time, if the party comes to power in Delhi. Shaheen Bagh has been projected as a raging issue for the forthcoming Delhi assembly polls by the BJP.

 Verma, an MP from West Delhi while seeking votes for his party at a community centre in Ranhoula village, said if the BJP comes to power on February 11, we will clear Shaheen Bagh of all the protesters within one hour.

 Verma’s statement comes after Union minister Anurag Thakur raised controversial ‘goli maaro’ slogan at a rally in New Delhi’s Rithala constituency. Thakur instigated the crowd to raise abusive slogan which meant ‘shoot the traitors’ on Monday, over which the Election Commission has sent a notice to him.  Verma had also said while talking to news agency ANI that only Modi government can save people from the protesters in Shaheen Bagh.  “The fire that broke-out in Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad may soon knock on Delhi people’s house.

1161,0,Tamil ,abc,"Breast cancer is a disease where the cells in the breast grow beyond control. It can begin in different parts of the breast, but generally, most begin in the Lobules of the Ducts. The lobules are the glands that produce milk and the ducts carry the milk to the nipple. The types of breast cancer that materialises through these parts are – Invasive Ductal Carcinoma and Invasive Lobular Carcinoma.

 According to multiple medical reports, the risk of breast cancer is higher in overweight women. The reports also state that women who are physically active for at least 30 minutes every day have a lower chance of contracting this disease. This is why it is important to incorporate physical exercise in your daily routine to keep a regular check on your weight.

 While moderate drinking is said to be good for the heart for older adults, consumption of even low levels of alcohol increases the risk of contracting breast cancer. It is also crucial to stop smoking, as it lowers the quality of life and increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and at least 15 types of cancer – which includes Breast Cancer.

 If you have a mother or sister who has been diagnosed with breast cancer in the past or has multiple family members with a history of breast, ovarian or prostate cancer, the chances of you contracting this disease increases significantly. As this type of cancer can be managed if caught early, learning the family medical history becomes of prime importance.

 Breast screening exams aim at detecting the cancer tumour at an early stage when they are too small for you to feel, or see, leading to a possibility of successful treatment. This makes screenings a the crucial step in every woman’s life and getting annual screenings are recommended for every woman over the age of 40.

 Nina Elavia Jaipuria, Head – Hindi Mass Entertainment & Kids TV Network, Viacom18 shares her Focus areas for 2020.

 Knowing our Consumer

 All our product and media offerings will start and end with the consumer, because it is very important for us to know the pulse of the consumer at all times. We are a business that is driven by consumer insights and priorities of our consumer, in fact we are obsessed with them. We will ensure that at all times, we understand our consumer and we know what they want, and that will help us to curate and sharpen our stories.

 One of the biggest focus areas will be to listen to our consumer, be obsessed about their lifestyle, their likes and their dislikes, their choices, their differences, and make sure that we have their pulse to ensure that we end up giving them what they really want. I think that’s a very big focus area, for us, it always has been, and it is something that will never go away.

 We will be able to know our consumer in a much better way with the help of Big Data and Use of data will lead to better decision making and help us to make our products, stories and characters preferable.

 Content

 COLORS stands for being innovative, bold, differentiated and for pioneering a lot that is happening in this category and we will continue to do so. We will continue to do everything I just mentioned to ensure that we give our viewers great stories, endearing characters, and newer genres to cater to their entertainment needs.

 One more reason why consumers prefer Colors as a channel is because we give them content across genres, whether it is drama, reality, action, adventure, social issues or volunteerism.

 We hope to make Bigg Boss bigger and better, as we go along in 2020 and soon after Bigg Boss we are launching Khatron Ke Khiladi with Rohit Shetty. KKK was the number one non-fiction show in 2019, we’re hoping to make it even better in 2020.

 Our Focus with KKK will be to continue and sustain the momentum that we have gained with Bigg Boss. We will launch Dance Dewaane on the weekend to ensure that we provide viewers with enough variety, right from adventure, drama, competition on the weekend with an equal focus on the weekday primetime as well.

 Our fiction shows Chhoti Sardarni and Vidya and Shakti are slot leaders in their own respective slots. These endearing characters with stellar stories will continue to entertain our viewers in the primetime and early-primetime.

 In a few weeks, our viewers will get two new shows; Naati Pinky Ki Lambi Love Story and Barrister Babu, both these shows are brand new offerings with one dealing with a few social. These concepts have never been done before on TV.

 These two shows will be launched very quickly in the next one or two months and then we have a very strong pipeline for 2020. However, I am not at the liberty of giving out all those names now, but we already have four to five shows ready to roll in the pipeline.

 New formats

 We want to continue to nurture the relationship and the bond that we have with our viewers over the years. We want to strengthen that bond so that they come to us day after day for more entertainment, and that’s going to be a very big Focus for us; telling great stories, endearing characters, path-breaking formats and content.

 We are partnering with Filmfare 2020. Viewers will see the next Filmfare Awards come on Colors in the month of February. Focus on big Bollywood events is going to be key in 2020 and we are starting the year with Filmfare.

 Engagement on Social Media

 The other big focus for us is to engage with our audiences outside of television, on a screen that is very dear to them in the form of social media through digital. In the past also, we have done a lot of engagement with our viewers on social media and we continue to make that a focus point for us going forward.

 We will continue to engage with audiences with our new Tik Tok handle. We have almost 3.2 million followers on Instagram, so social media engagement beyond television is going to be a big focus area for us and we will ensure that we leave no stone unturned to make sure that every show and every character that we have has a social media presence.

 Brand Awareness

 I think the other big focus area for us is about creating awareness about our brand and our shows. We will continue to have innovative, engaging marketing campaigns for every launch that we do. And of course, from the fact that there are the normal mass media campaigns that happen, we will ensure that we do a lot of innovations below the line to make sure that we continue to engage and create awareness.

 We are a very responsible brand and we have partnered with Pinkathon.

 Pinkathon is a very novel idea and it talks to women, promotes a healthy lifestyle. It empowers women to take time out for themselves to remain fit and follow a healthy lifestyle.

 Amid India’s worsening economic slowdown caused primarily by sluggish domestic demand for goods and services, exports could support economic growth. However, India’s exports in US dollar value terms have declined in six out of nine months in the current financial year, with December 2019 being the fifth straight month of contraction.

 Yet, sluggish exports are not getting the attention they deserve, neither in mainstream media nor among the policymakers despite an ambitious target of US $1 trillion in goods and services export by 2024-25. Contrary to widespread belief, a series of bad regulations and internal mismanagement – and not really exogenous factors – have worsened India’s export crisis.

 The upcoming Union Budget 2020-21, therefore, provides the Narendra Modi government the right opportunity to junk its raw material protectionism, end inverted duties, and ensure tax neutrality in textile fibres that have been hampering manufacturing exports – something that the government didn’t do in its previous Budgets despite the demand from several quarters of India Inc.

 Instead, the Modi government raised import duties on major industrial inputs such as ferrous and non-ferrous metals (steel and aluminium), parts and components for automobiles, camera, television and smartphones. To make matters worse, it has pulled out from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) – whose 15 countries account for 20 per cent of India’s merchandise exports, according to official data – and has been dragging its feet on a free trade deal with the European Union (which accounts for another 17 per cent) that could provide new opportunities to push exports.

 The sluggishness in India’s exports is not a recent phenomenon. Our merchandise exports have been hovering around US $300 billion. It was US $305 billion in FY 2011-12 and US $330 billion in FY 2018-19, even though the country’s GDP has gone up by over 60% from US $1.8 trillion to US $2.9 trillion during this period. The goods export has grown at a CAGR of 1.13 per cent between 2011-12 and 2018-19, and the prospects remain bleak in the current financial year, which is expected to post negative growth.

 The Modi government has been hinting that global headwinds are behind sluggish exports, and not without reason. The EU is struggling with Brexit-related uncertainties and slowing growth in its larger economies such as Germany and France. The Middle East, another major export destination for Indian merchandise, is troubled by its over-reliance on oil and gas, and regional political disturbances. Supply chains are now sourcing more locally than before. That is bound to affect India’s exports. Increasing trade protectionism, especially in the US, is creating further complications for India.

 However, it seems we are giving too much credit to unfavourable external factors for our export mess. India’s share in global merchandise export is so low (1.7 per cent) that it should be able to increase its share irrespective of external conditions. Given this backdrop, it would be interesting to analyse what’s been holding up India’s exports for long.

 The most important factor responsible for India’s export stagnation is a narrow export basket. Not more than 20 product groups out of 99 account for 80 per cent of the total exports. We are targeting a smaller global export pie (20 per cent, even as the balance remains largely untapped) and a narrow set of time-tested low-risk markets in Europe, North America, South East and West Asia. Even within Europe, the EU accounts for 90 per cent of India’s total export to the region – something similar to the US in North America. However, the whole of Latin America, Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and Baltic states together account for less than 5 per cent of India’s total merchandise exports. That’s why the country’s total export remains so low compared to the GDP.

 To make matters worse, barring automobiles and a few other items, most of India’s exports are a commodity in nature, that is, undifferentiated products with no brand or pricing power. Thus, a woollen suit that retails for US $2,000-2,500 in New York or Tokyo doesn’t fetch more than US $200-250 for its Indian exporter. Just like IT and BPO services, most of India’s goods exports such as apparels or leather goods survive on exploiting labour cost arbitrage. No wonder India is losing to countries such as Bangladesh and Ethiopia, which not only have a competitive edge over labour cost but also have preferential access to top consuming markets such as Europe and North America.

 India’s excessive raw material protectionism, which often results in inverted duties – lower import duties on finished goods and higher duties on raw material – discourages manufacturing, and, in turn, export of value-added products. In fact, it induces imports of high-value merchandise. That’s not difficult to understand. If the raw material is expensive, the finished products are most likely to be expensive.

 Thus, higher import duty on polyester and synthetic fibres, compared to those on apparels, is incentivising import of apparels into India rather than their export out of India. As there is more demand for synthetic fibres-based clothing in international markets, India’s fibre import policy is actually pushing export of low-value raw material such as cotton fibre and yarn to China rather than apparels to the EU and the US. Shrinking domestic demand for apparels aggravates the misery of Indian apparel manufacturers. Why produce apparels in India when you can import them cheap and duty-free from countries like Myanmar or Ethiopia?

 Similarly, being a common industrial input, expensive steel (due to India’s excessive steel protectionism that has increased under the Modi government) is imposing cost inefficiencies on much more dynamic downstream products such as automobile and auto components, engineering goods, electrical equipment and machineries, and in turn, dampens their export prospects. It makes the import of steel-intensive capital goods such as earthmovers, bulldozers and cranes more economical and attractive for users.

 Logistics inefficiencies, especially those related to ports and customs, further put India’s merchandise exports at a disadvantage. Concerns on quality and safety remain a key deterrent for importers of Indian food and pharmaceutical products. Moreover, India has failed to take advantage of free trade agreements (FTAs) and regional trade agreements (RTAs) to push exports, mainly because of lack of domestic reforms – for instance, those related to land and labour markets as well as increasing raw material protectionism. One FTA that could give a big boost to India’s export is with the EU, but the Modi government has not been able to break the deadlock on negotiation by being extremely unreasonable on investment protection.

 Relatively poor export performance adds to India’s current account woes and chops off a few hundred basis points of GDP growth. Given this backdrop, an over-valued exchange rate is bound to hurt India’s export price competitiveness, but a weaker currency may not help much in pushing exports. That remains India’s major exchange rate policy dilemma.

 To give a real boost to exports, it is important to realise that India’s bigger challenge is internal, even though it keeps raising fingers towards unfavourable external factors such as increasing trade protectionism. Moreover, too much focus on demand for incentives and tax sops to compensate for many of the disabilities, such as logistical inefficiencies, prevents India from analysing the contributory role of poor regulations that have been hampering the country’s exports for long.

 What Indian exporters, potential or actual, need on priority are prudent actions that effectively deal with the country’s bad regulation pile-up, which has proven disadvantageous for Indian merchandise vis-a-vis competing countries. This calls for putting an end to raw material protectionism and inverted duties to start with. Export sops, in any case, will have to be phased out as they violate World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. India needs to think beyond subsidies. It must also broaden the product and market mix. It can’t excessively rely upon a few product groups, such as refined petroleum products, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, and textiles, or a few low risk markets such as Europe and North America to achieve its US $1 trillion export target by 2024-25 without effectively dealing with internal impediments. The question is: will Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s upcoming Budget on 1 February deliver on this?

1165,0,Hindi,pqr,"JAIPUR : As the five-day-long Jaipur Literature Festival came to an end on Monday, Stephen Greenblatt, an American Shakespearean, literary historian, and author gave an interesting talk on how Lucretius was rediscovered by Poggio Bracciolini in 1417. Greenblatt took the audience on a journey of Lucretius’ work during a session titled The Swerve: How the Renaissance began and The World Became Modern.

 One day, nearly 600 years ago, Bracciolini, who was in his late 30s took a book off the shelf that he found in a monastery, probably in southern Germany. “He saw a copy of a Roman poet Titus Lucretius Carus, whom he had read about but whose work no one in his world had either seen or been able to read. He knew of the poem On the Nature of Things which was written in 50 BCE, around the time of Julius Caesar, had been extravagantly mentioned by several other Roman poets. This man asked for the book to be copied. That was an extremely unnoticeable event yet it was enough to set in motion the transformation of the world whose consequences we are still facing today,” said Greenblatt.

 The book that Bracciolini found had virtually disappeared by then, dropped out of circulation and was not part of the conversation, unlike the other works, from the ancient world like that of Aristotle and Plato. “Poggio, was among those who knew that there was a chance that certain books that they didn’t have a chance to read but knew of, could have a chance to survive. Poggio, who is also the hero of my book The Swerve: How The World Became Modern, was probably one of greatest of the Renaissance book hunters.”

 The need for book hunting arose because the Roman world fell apart in fifth, sixth and seventh centuries. One major impact was that the schools got shut, education basically came to a halt and the enterprise of copying books stopped that in turn enabled the survival and distribution of text to the world. “This caused a massive loss in the intellectual world. Aeschylus, the one who laid the Greek foundation of tragic playwright wrote between 80-90 plays, of which only seven survived. And there are many such instances. In Italy, in the 14 and 15 centuries, book hunters went in search of some of these lost treasures.”

 The lost poem Bracciolini found, that was particularly hard hit in the ancient world was because of the philosophy of Epicureanism. Lucretius was the disciple of the Greek philosopher Epicurus, who wrote many works and almost none of them survived. “Its this work of Lucretius that carries the full weight of Epicureanism and the reason why this philosophy was so hard hit is beyond the general historical decline.

 It was because none of the great religions of the ancient world liked what it had to say. So, the recovery of 7,400 lines of Epicurean verse was an extraordinary event.”After the discovery of the poem, the idea of Epicureanism began to circulate repeatedly. You get glimpses of this idea in works of Galileo, subsequently in Isaac Newton and then in a massive flood in Einstein, in Darwin and Karl Marx. “All their works can be traced to what Poggio Bracciolini brought into the world.”

 It has challenged the vires of Section 14-A of the Citizenship Act, 1955 which was inserted through an amendment in 2004 on the ground that this provision empowered the Centre to “compulsorily register” every citizen of India and to issue national identity card to one.

 Bigg Boss 13 is getting more and more interesting as it is inching towards its finale. The contestants are making new game plans to win the coveted title. The contenders are fighting, arguing and using abusive language or words to show themselves string than the others.

 Last night’s episode took off from a discussion between Mahira Sharma, Sid and Desai in the kitchen zone. During the same, Rashami shared that she had hidden the cup.

 Rashami asked Sid if it is his plan to be nice to her suddenly. And he replied by saying that he is just himself. The next morning, the housemates woke up to yet another hit number. And after quite a few episodes, Shehnaaz came back to her form.

 Subsequently, Asim spoke to Sid and tried to solve the misunderstandings between them. He apologized to him for all the happenings.

 Moving forward, Shehnaaz told Sid that she got hurt when he avoids her and she clarified that no matter where she is, she will support him.

 When SidNaaz talked to each other, Asim and Rashami laughed. Asim even sung “do dil mil rahe hain” after looking at the duo.

 Sidharth gets annoyed after seeing Asim singing the song, and he asks him not to link him to anyone by singing the song.

 Later, Gill carried on explaining her standpoint to Sid, but he felt that it’s useless to talk over anything anymore.

 During evening, Asim asked Sana to tell Sid what her game plan is. Asim felt that Sana is playing a smart game, and Vishal seconds him. Little later, when Sana came back to the bedroom, Sid asked her what’s happening in her head. And then she said how he spent the majority of his time with Jariwala and others. In the end, Shehnaaz told Sid that he is free to talk to her if he is close to her, but she is in no mood to talk over the game with him.

 Bigg Boss showed the housemates videotape that showed Asim and Vishal discussing the nomination process. Paras was shocked after seeing the recording.

 Bigg Boss admonished Asim and Vishal not to repeat the mistake as he wouldn’t spare them again if they break the rules. Vishal was seen telling Asim not to give “footage” to Paras. After this, Paras was angry and told Vishal that he doesn’t need “footage”. The spat over the matter intensified so much that Rashami joined the heated discussion. Shehnaaz was on Asim, Vishal and Rashami’s side as she is always against Paras and Mahira, while Sidharth maintains a stoic silence.

 Interestingly, even as Rashami and Paras fight, Shehnaaz returned to Sid’s bed. She insisted on talking to him, but she evaded by telling her he would speak to her tomorrow. And then, Shehnaaz hugged Sidharth.

 Subsequently, Shehnaaz got excited after Sid talked to her. However, she told him that she doesn’t like it when someone else hugged and kissed him.

 During the evening, the nomination task started with Vishal. After the task, Bigg Boss declared the outcome and disclosed that Vishal, Arti, Sidharth and Shehnaaz got nominated.

 The episode ended Sidharth telling Shehnaaz that he spoke to her as it was her birthday.

1169,0,Hindi,xyz,"Overweight adults who follow the Mediterranean, intermittent fasting and paleo diets can accrue weight loss and other health benefits, suggests new research.

 Intermittent fasting - whereby participants limit their energy intake to about 25 per cent of their usual diet (500kcal for women and 600kcal for men) on two self-selected days per week, led to slightly more weight loss than the other diets, showed the results of the one-year study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

 The amount of weight loss was modest - on average two to four kilograms for the 250 participants, but for those choosing the fasting or Mediterranean diets, clinically significant improvements in blood pressure were also seen, said co-lead author Melyssa Roy, Research Fellow at the University of Otago in New Zealand.

 After 12 months, the average weight loss was 4 kg for those choosing the fasting diet, 2.8 kg on the Mediterranean diet and 1.8 kg on the paleo diet, said the study.

 The aim of the research was to examine how effective all three diets were in a “real world” setting, where participants self-selected which diet they wished to follow, without any ongoing support from a dietitician.

 The evidence shows that for some people the Mediterranean, fasting or paleo (Paleolithic) diets can be “healthful, beneficial ways to eat”, Roy said.

 “Like the Mediterranean diet, intermittent fasting and paleo diets can also be valid healthy eating approaches - the best diet is the one that includes healthy foods and suits the individual.”

 The Mediterranean diet encouraged consumption of fruit, vegetables, wholegrain breads and cereals, legumes, nuts, seeds and olive oil with moderate amounts of fish, chicken, eggs and dairy and red meat once a week or less.

 The paleo diet consists of mostly less-processed foods with an emphasis on eating fruit and vegetables, animal proteins, nuts, coconut products and extra-virgin olive oil. While “original” paleo diets strictly exclude all legumes, dairy and grains, this study used a modified version including some dairy as well as up to one serving daily of legumes and grain-based food.

 The results showed people found the Mediterranean diet to be the easiest to adhere to, said co-lead author Michelle Jospe, a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Otago.

 Most of the 250 participants (54 per cent) chose the fasting diet, while 27 per cent chose the Mediterranean and 18 per cent the paleo.

 After 12 months, the Mediterranean diet had the best retention rate with 57 per cent of participants continuing, with 54 per cent still fasting and 35 per cent still on the paleo diet.

 Reduced systolic blood pressure was observed among those participating in the fasting and Mediterranean diets, together with reduced blood sugar levels in the Mediterranean diet.

1170,0,Gujarati,pqr,"As a high-fat, adequate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet known as Ketogenic diet, has been touted as one of best weight loss programs, at the same time been dismissed by many. People who wish to give it a try, need to clearly understand if they will be able to sustain such a drastic change in eating habits that too in a safe manner.

 According to USA Today, the ketogenic diet involves consuming a low carbohydrate, high fat and high protein diet.

 Out of the total daily caloric intake, nearly 70 to 80 per cent comes from fat, 20 per cent from protein and the remaining 5 per cent or so are derived from carbohydrates.

 The carbohydrate deprivation pushes the body into ketosis, which is a state where fat becomes its primary fuel source.

 Despite its ability to cause rapid weight loss, this dieting approach doesn’t find many supporters among medical professionals.

 The Keto diet is usually not recommended by doctors for the reason that it excludes a wide array of essential food groups that are imperative for optimal health, such as grains, fruits, and some vegetables.

 Medical professionals caution people to be aware of the difference between weight loss and overall health.

 Jeffrey Mechanick a medical director at Mount Sinai Heart’s Marie-Josee and Henry R. Kravis Center for Clinical Cardiovascular Health quite frankly stated to USA Today that “I wouldn’t recommend the keto diet to anybody.”

 Vasanti Malik, an adjunct assistant professor of Nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, expressed her concern regarding this extreme system of eating.

 “You want to be mindful because these foods - whole grains, fruits, and vegetables - carry a number of beneficial nutrients - vitamins, polyphenols, fibre - that have been shown time and time again to be beneficial for cardiometabolic health,” Malik told USA Today.

 According to Mechanick, depletion of carbohydrates compels the body to scavenge upon its fat and muscle tissue to keep everything up and running.

 “In theory, the Keto diet basically mimics starvation. If you don’t eat carbohydrates but you eat an excessive amount of fat and protein, you’re still going to waste tissue. The tissue is still going to burn off,” explained Mechanick.

 Fad diets such as keto also lead to weight rebound issues with people who are not able to stick to them after losing weight.

 The answer for sustainable weight loss hence lies with emphasising on the quality of food and not exclusively the number of calories that are consumed.

 Mechanik suggests the minimisation of sugars and starches and an increased intake of vegetables, fruits, nuts, and beans.

 Malik recommends people to include more grains, fruits, vegetables and nuts, while limiting saturated fat, added sugar and added sodium. Tidying up your menu, in conjugation with daily physical exercise would be enough to create a solid foundation for health.

 Priyanka Chopras Grammys plunging outfit was an instant hit on Monday as she went all bold and beautiful in a Ralph and Russo gown. The actress was tagged as Best dressed in many international fashion websites but there were some who trolled and criticised her for the dress neckline. While Priyanka didnt respond to the reactions coming her way, Bollywood actress Suchitra Krishnamoorthi took to her Instagram handle to hit back at the fashion police.

 Krishnamoorthi took a dig at designer Wendell Rodricks comment on Priyankas red-carpet appearance who wrote: the neckline goes all the way from LA to Cuba. In a long detailed post, Krishnamoorthi wrote:

 Was so upset to see this post on insta by Wendel Rodrigues who’s work I otherwise have a modicum of respect for. I think the fact that Priyanka is not trying to hide her belly with her clutch is what makes this pic so beautiful. Makes her the rockstar she is. Her confidence an inspiration to every woman. Women have been so enslaven by men’s opinion of how women should look this photograph of Priyanka to me at the world’s most publicized event is the height of liberation. You go girl and keep rocking it. I was never a fan of the lady but this pic has surely made me one.

 Canadian TV actor Kaitlyn Bristowe of The Bachelorette fame too dropped a comment on Priyankas family picture at Grammys and said, Beautiful powerful women. Disgusting comments from sad women.

 Paramedics were called to a pub in the state of Queensland on Sunday afternoon after a woman was involved in a medical incident.

 Nvidia GeForce 1650 graphics cards have been spotted on Geekbench. These cards are expected to get featured quite sooner on the laptops, to provide ultra-smooth gaming experience. The graphics processors can be seen on the Geekbench listing in two variants-- GeForce GTX 1650 Ti and GeForce 1650 Super. And, the arriving dates of these graphics cards are yet to be announced. We can, however, expect the GTX 1650 Ti being shipped to an unnamed Lenovo laptop.

 Now, according to a report, the mobile version of GeForce GTX 1650 Ti bears 1,024 CUDA cores, 1,490MHz boost clock, 4GB GDDR6 (12Gbps), and 128-bit bus. And, Mobile variant of GeForce GTX 1650 Super comes with 896 CUDA cores, 1,560GHz boost clock, 4GB GDDR6 (12Gbps), and 128-bit bus.

 Out of the two GPUs, the mobile GTX 1650 Super comes with a slight sluggish boost clock and faster memory, but experience-wise it is similar to the desktop GeForce GTX 1650. On the other hand, mobile GeForce GTX 1650 Ti is a reduced version of the desktop GeForce GTX 1650 Super.

 As scores penned by previously surfaced Geekbench data, the GeForce GTX 1650 Super and GeForce GTX 1650 Ti bear 44246 and 130316 as openCL points, respectively. However, we are likely to see more changes in Geekbench with variable score points for the GPUs, until they get launched.

 As of the latest Geekbench 5, the desktop GeForce GTX 1650 Super scores 52,356 points. Based on the points, mobile GeForce GTX 1650 Super lags to the desktop variant by 17 percent. Given that the CUDA cores of the mobile variant are slightly lower than the desktop version, the slight difference would not affect the performance of the mobile GeForce GTX 1650 Super.

 Things related to both the GPUs are uncertain now. We are even not sure what more new revealings Nvidia will come out with. However, based on several rumors we can expect the unveiling of these GPUs during GTC, to be held in March.

 Every time, Saif Ali Khan, Kareena Kapoor Khan and their little munchkin Taimur Ali Khan step out of their house, they managed to grab everyone’s attention. Often fans run behind the Kareena, Saif and Taimur for photos and selfies and it gets worse when they are at the airport. While both Saif and Kareena often oblige fans with selfies and get clicked at the airport, at times, there have been cases when fans didn’t stop asking for selfies or coming in their way which led to the Jawaani Jaaneman actor getting miffed.

 In a recent interview with Mumbai Mirror, Saif opened up about the difficulties he and Kareena go through at times with Taimur when fans seek selfies and follow them around. Saif mentioned that he understands that it comes with the territory and that they try to take it in their stride. But, it gets difficult at times as people don’t stop. The Jawaani Jaaneman actor stated that he is thinking about getting some extra security for next time as he doesn’t want people to step on Taimur.

 Saif said, “One of the worst places to be is a couple of feet behind a Bollywood celebrity, because people will trample you, your parent and child, to get a picture. They are not bothered if it’s offensive or intrusive. Maybe I will get some extra security for us at the airport next time because I don’t want anyone stepping on my son. But again, it goes with the territory, that’s what landing back in Mumbai is all about. And given the many advantages to a celebrity’s life, we take it in our stride. Of course, it would have been nicer if it wasn’t there.”

 Meanwhile, Saif also spoke about his holidays with Kareena and Taimur. Khan even revealed that he was debating making his Instagram debut due to the holiday photos. However, he still hasn’t gone ahead with it. Meanwhile, on the work front, Saif is gearing up for the release of Jawaani Jaaneman that stars Tabu and Alaya F. The film is directed by Nitin Kakkar and is produced by Jackky Bhagnani, Deepshikha Deshmukh, Saif Ali Khan and Jay Shewakramani. Jawaani Jaaneman will hit the screens on January 31, 2020.

While this year’s broadcast saw roughly six percent drop from last year’s show which managed to attract 19.9 million viewers, the fall was deeper when compared to Television ratings of the ceremony’s 2012 edition, Fox News reported. This year, Grammy faced a striking 53 percent drop from 2012, which gathered 39.9 million viewers.

 The Grammy did not leave any stone unturned while organising an engaging show for the audience. It included powerful performances by Demi Lovato, Jonas Brothers, Lizo, Ariana Grande and Camila Cabello. The producers even added a short performance by popular Korean band BTS to attract their huge fan base, all these strategies did not work out for Grammys. It was also a big night for Billie Eilish and her fans. The 18-year-old singer made history as the young artist to win the four biggest awards including Song of the Year and Album of the Year.

 The record was previously held by Taylor Swift, who won the title when she was 20, for her album Fearless. The Grammys also featured several tributes to NBA legend Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash hours before the ceremony began. Lizzo took the reins with her stunning performance and began it by saying This ones for Kobe. The celebrities who did not step on the stage for a performance or to receive awards, presented awards to their fellow music industry members. In short, it had something for everybody and a lot of its content even went viral online, yet there was a drop in the building.

1195,0,English,pqr,"Zimbabwe 352 for 6 (Williams 107, Raza 72, Taylor 62, Lakmal 2-31) v Sri Lanka

 Sean Williams produced a consummate captains knock, scoring his second Test century, and Zimbabwe, with cameos from Brendan Taylor and Sikandar Raza, seized control of proceedings on the first day of the second Harare Test. While Williams dismissal in the final hour of play gave a slightly more balanced look to proceedings, the hosts still ended the day on 352 for 6 with Regis Chakabva and debutant Tinotenda Mutombodzi at the crease, their partnership unbeaten on 28.

 For Sri Lanka, on a flat, dry surface that offered little assistance to their trio of seamers, it was the dependable Suranga Lakmal that was nevertheless the catalyst for their most incisive period of play, as he ended the day with two wickets. Dhananjaya de Silva too picked up a pair.

 Williams was aided for a majority of his stay by Raza, the pair coming together with Zimbabwe in a spot of bother at 133 for 4. Lakmals probing lines and ability to seam the ball both ways caused them a few problems early on, but once they weathered that storm they found runs easier to come by. Both Williams and Raza utilised the sweep to good effect, while they were also unafraid to use their feet to smother spin and play down the ground.

 It helped that early on in their partnership - which would eventually yield 159 runs - Lasith Embuldeniya was forced off the field, having copped a blow on his bowling hand attempting to take a difficult chance offered up by Raza. Embuldeniya would later return to bowl, seemingly without much discomfort.

 During this period, it was Williams who was by far the more aggressive of the two, regularly using his feat against the spinners, with the nature of the pitch such that anything full was there to be driven. Williams lofted Embuldeniya down the ground for six more than once in this manner.

 Raza for his part was more selective. Though an entertaining period of play did see him attempt a series of pulls off Lahiru Kumara to varying degrees of success, culminating in one being creamed for six over the midwicket boundary.

 It was Kumara, however, that got the last laugh, as one pull too many saw Raza find an onrushing Angelo Mathews in the deep, who completed a good diving catch.

 Williams though would continue to hold firm putting on 32 more runs with Chakabva, before a tired attempt at a slog sweep against Dhananjaya saw his stumps rattled, bringing a disappointing end to what had been an outstanding innings.

 Earlier, Brendan Taylors run-a-ball 62 had resurrected Zimbabwes innings after they had crawled to 50 for 2 at the end of the 20th over, in danger of squandering the best of the batting conditions. Off just his sixth delivery Taylor signalled his intent, coming down the track to Embuldeniya, and lofting him for six over long-off.

 On a pitch that had shown some bite and turn, most of the Zimbabwean batters had for the most part done well to prevent Sri Lankas spinners from settling. It was first Craig Ervine, then Taylor, and eventually Williams who took it upon themselves to play the role of aggressor, either coming down the track, sweeping or cutting.

 It didnt help Sri Lankas cause that the pitch seemed to slow quite a bit as the day wore on with the seamers gradually losing their potency. It raised the question as to whether the think tank had missed a trick in choosing to bring in an extra seamer in Vishwa Fernando, as opposed to the spin of Lakshan Sandakan.

 It also looked to be a concerted plan from Zimbabwe to target Sri Lankas spinners - and Embuldeniya in particular - as Ervine, in his brief cameo had also launched the young left-arm spinner down the ground for six and a four.

 Ervine had looked in good touch, but was dismissed after failing to read a slider from Dhananjaya that caught the inside edge of his bat on the way to short leg.

 Prince Masvaure had nicked a wide one from Kumara through to the keeper, to give Sri Lanka their first breakthrough of the day.

 Despite the fall of wickets, Taylor would proceed to sweep and reverse sweep frequently as Zimbabwe continued their counter-attack. This tactic, though, may well have been his downfall had the umpire not failed to spot Taylor gloving a reverse sweep to the keeper when he was on 7. With DRS not available for this series, Zimbabwes most experienced player survived.

 Taylor fell shortly after the lunch interval, when Lakmal was causing all sorts of trouble. Unerring in his examination of the area outside off stump, Lakmal would tail a fuller delivery in towards leg stump, catching Taylor flush on the pads.

 Kevin Kazusa meanwhile, had looked uncertain throughout his innings, which ended with an ill-advised leave off Lakmal as the ball to jagged back in from outside off and hit the top of off stump.

 At that point Sri Lankas bowlers wouldve been looking to scythe through Zimbabwes middle order, but Williams and Raza had other ideas.

 The brother of rapper Nicki Minaj was sentenced Monday to 25 years to life in prison for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl at his Long Island home.

 A judge convicted Jelani Maraj of predatory sexual assault and child endangerment in November 2017. The victim testified during the trial that Maraj repeatedly raped her in 2015 while her mother was at work.

 Prosecutors have said DNA evidence recovered from the girl’s pajama pants was linked to Maraj. The girl’s younger brother also testified at the trial that he witnessed one assault.

 Maraj’s attorney appealed conviction in 2018, claiming that there was jury misconduct. The judge ruled in October that the defense did not meet the necessary burden of proof.

 Maraj said in court Monday that he had an alcohol problem and asked for a “second chance.” One of his attorneys said he suffered from health issues including hypertension, gout and anemia and requested the minimum sentence of 10 years to life.

 Maraj’s appellate attorney, Stephen Scaring, said he plans to appeal the judge’s decision.

 A CPM activist who allegedly immolated himself at Geeta Bhavan Square, Indore, on Friday succumbed to his burns late on Sunday.

 Rameshchandra Prajapat, a tailor, had sustained nearly 90 per cent burns and was being treated at M Y Hospital.

 In-charge of Tukoganj Police Station Nirmal Kumar Shrivas said it was not clear why the 72-year-old took the extreme step because the police could not record his statement. He did not leave any note. Shrivas said CCTV footage showed that he did not raise any slogans and was alone when the incident happened.

 A bag carrying anti-CAA pamphlets had been found lying near him which led many to speculate that the septuagenarian immolated himself to register his protest against the new citizenship law.

 His son Deepak Prajapat, 30, however, insisted that the step his father took had nothing to do with the new citizenship law. Other family members and Prajapat community demanded a judicial inquiry into the incident on Monday.

 CPM leaders claimed Prajapat was disturbed by the new law and the country-wide protests and could have been driven to take the extreme step due to this.

 NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) are planning to launch the ‘Solar Orbiter’, a new spacecraft that will travel to the Sun to capture the first pictures of its north and south poles. The spacecraft will use the gravity of Venus and Earth to swing itself out of the ecliptic plane — the swath of space, roughly aligned with the Sun’s equator, where all planets orbit.

 The spacecraft will launch from Cape Canaveral on February 7, 2020, at 11:15 pm EST which converts to 9:45 am IST on February 8, 2020. Once the spacecraft is out of the ecliptic plane, it will proceed to snap the first-ever look at the Sun’s poles with its bird’s eye view, NASA said.

 “Up until Solar Orbiter, all solar imaging instruments have been within the ecliptic plane or very close to it,” said Russell Howard, space scientist at the Naval Research Lab in Washington, DC and principal investigator for one of Solar Orbiter’s ten instruments. “Now, we’ll be able to look down on the Sun from above.”

 The Sun plays a central role in shaping space around us as we know it and its massive magnetic field stretches far beyond Pluto, paving a superhighway for charged solar particles known as the solar wind. “When bursts of solar wind hit Earth, they can spark space weather storms that interfere with our GPS and communications satellites — at their worst, they can even threaten astronauts,” NASA said.

 These space images taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope look like modern art

 The scientists monitor the Sun’s magnetic field in order to prepare for arriving solar storms but we only get a sidelong glimpse of the Sun’s poles from within the ecliptic plane, which leaves major gaps in the data.

 “The poles are particularly important for us to be able to model more accurately,” said Holly Gilbert, NASA project scientist for the mission at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “For forecasting space weather events, we need a pretty accurate model of the global magnetic field of the Sun.”

 The only prior spacecraft to fly over the Sun’s poles was also a joint ESA/NASA venture launched in 1990. The Ulysses spacecraft made three passes around the Sun before being decommissioned in 2009. However, while Ulysses never got closer than Earth-distance to the Sun, the Solar Orbiter will pass inside the orbit of Mercury carrying four in situ instruments (which measure the space environment immediately around the spacecraft like the sense of touch) and six remote-sensing imagers (which see the Sun from afar).

 After years of technology development, it will be the closest any Sun-facing cameras have ever gotten to the Sun. “You can’t really get much closer than Solar Orbiter is going and still look at the Sun,” Müller said.

1201,0,Tamil ,abc,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the UK and has a poor five-year survival rate of around 13 per cent. Research led by the University of Exeter Medical School, published in the British Journal of General Practice, aimed to improve potentially life-saving early diagnosis through analysing which symptoms patients present first to their doctor. The team examined 27,795 records of adults who were diagnosed with lung cancer between 2,000 and 2017, at more than 600 UK GP practices.

 Over the 17 year period, the team found an increase in both cough and shortness of breath as the first symptom patients reported when they went on to be diagnosed with lung cancer. The study, funded by Cancer Research UK and supported by NIHR, found a decrease in patients who reported the first symptom to be coughing up blood, or loss of appetite, generally regarded as the headline symptom of lung cancer.

 Professor Willie Hamilton of the University of Exeter Medical School, who was an author on the paper, said: “Lung cancer is the biggest cancer killer in the UK. Our paper shows a rapid change in the first symptom doctors is seeing. That’s probably not caused by any change in basic biology, it’s more likely to be down to earlier detection. “It means teaching must change — clinicians must be alert to the risks of cough and shortness of breath.”

 Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, said: “This important study indicates that people are now going to the doctor about different symptoms of lung cancer, such as cough and shortness of breath, possibly because of awareness campaigns in the past. Most people with these symptoms will not have lung cancer, but it’s well worth letting your GP decide if you need tests – because if it is cancer, prompt diagnosis and speedy treatment make all the difference. And although smoking makes it much more likely, remember that non-smokers can have lung cancer too.

1202,0,Tamil ,abc,"According to the Parkinson’s Foundation, Parkinson’s affects 1 million people in the United States and over 10 million worldwide. The symptoms develop slowly over time and can be debilitating to patients, who most recognizably develop tremor, slow movements, and a shuffling gait. The study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A key feature of Parkinson’s disease is a protein named a-synuclein, which accumulates in an abnormal form in brain cells causing them to degenerate and die.

 However, it has been difficult to target a-synuclein because it does not have a fixed structure and keeps changing its shape, making it very difficult for drugs to target. Because higher levels of the protein in the brain speed the degeneration of brain cells, scientists have been looking for ways to decrease protein production as a form of treatment.

 In 2014, Parkinson’s disease expert and scientist M. Maral Mouradian, William Dow Lovett Professor of Neurology and director of the Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School Institute for Neurological Therapeutics, contacted Matthew D. Disney, chemistry professor at Scripps Research in Florida, to explore a novel idea for treating Parkinson’s disease using a new technology developed by Disney.

 Disney’s method matches the RNA structure with small molecules or drug-like compounds. The two collaborators believed this innovative technology could be used to find a drug that targets the messenger RNA that codes for a-synuclein, which causes the disease, in order to reduce the production of the protein in the brains of Parkinson’s patients. Since the protein itself can’t be treated with drugs, RNA could be a more robust and reliable target.

 The study showed that by targeting messenger RNA, the team found a compound that prevents the harmful Parkinson’s protein from being made. This new compound, named Synucleozid, reduces specifically a-synuclein levels and protects cells against the toxicity of the misfolded form of the protein, suggesting that it has the potential of preventing disease progression. “We found the molecule to be very selective at both the RNA level and the protein level,” Disney says.

 “Several other experimental drugs currently being tested for Parkinson’s disease are antibodies that target a very late stage of a-synuclein protein aggregates. We want to prevent these protein clumps from forming in the first place before they do damage and lead to advancing disease.,” she said. “This new compound has the potential to do that and could change the course of life for people with this devastating disease.”

 Mouradian says this discovery is ‘highly promising’ and is eager for the next steps in optimizing and testing the compound. Additionally, this can benefit another devasting disease that also has a-synuclein clumps, known as Dementia with Lewy Bodies. Further, this new concept of targeting RNA to reduce protein production developed in Disney’s lab at Scripps Research may be applied to other challenging diseases because of their similar undruggable proteins including Alzheimer’s disease.

 Within hours of hearing of Bryants death Sunday, Coelho announced that he would delete the draft, rather than finish the book without the 41-year-old five-time NBA champion.

 “I deleted the draft because it didnt make any sense to publish without him, Coelho said by phone on Monday from his home in Geneva. “It wouldnt add anything relevant to him or his family.

 “That doesnt stop me from writing someday about things I learned from Kobe and how much of a larger-than-life person he was,” Coelho said. But the childrens book did not make sense anymore.

 Coelhos decision disappointed many of Bryants fans, who flooded the writers social media channels asking for the draft not to be erased.

 Bryant was a fan of Coelhos and called The Alchemist his favorite book. He recommended it to everyone from former teammate Kyrie Irving to Rob Pelinka, his former agent who now runs the Lakers basketball operations.

 Pelinka read a passage from the book before a news conference in July 2018 shortly after the Lakers signed LeBron James, who was photographed reading The Alchemist before a shootaround in the 2018 Eastern Conference finals when he played for the Cleveland Cavaliers.

 Coelho, who has sold tens of millions of books, said the idea behind his collaboration with Bryant was to inspire underprivileged children to overcome adversity through sports.

 “Kobe was always very concerned about making a book that was a positive example for children, especially those coming from humble beginnings,” Coelho said.

 Bryants 13-year-old daughter Gianna also died in the crash, along with seven others. Bryant has three other daughters.

 The book project was very casual. After not communicating for several months, Bryant sent a message to Coelho in August, saying “Lets right that book together.” He then texted the correct spelling of “write.

 “It went from there. Little by little we were going ahead,” Coelho said. He did not reveal how many pages had been written or whether the book already had a title.

 Bryants Granity Studios published middle grade and young adult novels. It also put out the players autobiography, The Mamba Mentality: How I Play, released in 2018.

 “I saw him enough times to assure he had much more than sports on his mind, it wasnt all about competition, Coelho said. “His tragic death has shown already how he was important to the world, not only to the United States. We will discuss his legacy for many years, much beyond sport.

1205,0,English,pqr,"Sao Paulo: Kobe Bryant and Brazilian writer Paulo Coelho were working together on a childrens book, but the author of The Alchemist said he deleted the draft after Bryants death in a helicopter crash.

 The 72-year-old novelist told The Associated Press on Monday that the two men started discussing the project in 2016, when Bryant retired after a 20-year NBA career. They began writing a few months ago.

 Within hours of hearing of Bryants death Sunday, Coelho announced that he would delete the draft, rather than finish the book without the 41-year-old five-time NBA champion.

 “I deleted the draft because it didnt make any sense to publish without him, Coelho said by phone on Monday from his home in Geneva. “It wouldnt add anything relevant to him or his family.

1206,0,Hindi,xyz,"NEW DELHI:  The direct tax code report submitted by the Akhilesh Ranjan-led panel to the government has suggested that the income tax slabs be relaxed giving relief to middle-class taxpayers. However, given its state of finances, the government may find it a tough job to go ahead with implementing it in its entirety and may instead go in for cherry-picking parts of it.

 The direct tax panel has suggested that 10 per cent tax on incomes between Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh with full tax rebate up to incomes of Rs 5 lakh, a 20 per cent tax on incomes between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 20 lakh and a 30 per cent tax on incomes between Rs 20 lakh and Rs 2 crore and a flat 35 per cent tax on incomes beyond that. This is against a current tax regime of 5 per cent tax for incomes between Rs 2.5 lakh and Rs 5 lakh, 10 per cent for incomes between Rs 5 lakh – Rs 10 lakh, 20 per cent for incomes between Rs 10 lakh – Rs 20 lakh and 30 per cent for incomes beyond Rs 20 lakh.

 There is a 4 per cent cess at all tax rates and a 10 per cent surcharge on incomes between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 1 crore and a 15 per cent surcharge for incomes over Rs 1 crore, dubbed by tax-practitioners as the ‘Rich Tax’. The DTC panel also suggested removal of all surcharges and cesses on income tax, though this suggestion is unlikely to be accepted given the fact that cesses and surcharges go exclusively into the Central kitty, while taxes are divisible between Centre and states.

 Officials said there would be some relaxations on tax slabs, but these may not correspond to the panel’s recommendations. Top revenue officials said the DTC recommendations, which cover a wide gamut besides tax slabs, including tax treatment of foreign investment, taxes on dividend and wealth, had been “taken into account while formulating the budget…”.

1207,0,Telugu,abc,"Having reached their yield low at 1.32% in July 2016, US government 10 year bond yields have been locked in, just shy of, a 2% range for the last two and half years (subsequent high 3.25% and low 1.43%). For yields to fall again, supply must fall, demand rise or central banks, recommence their experimental monetary policies of negative interest rates and quantitative easing. For yields to rise, supply must rise, demand fall or central banks reverse their multi-year largesse. Besides supply, demand and monetary policy there are, however, other factors to consider.

 One justification for a rise in US bond yields would be an uptick in inflationary pressure. Aging demographic have been the principal driver of the downward trajectory of secular inflation. During the next decade, however, Generation Y borrowing will accelerate whilst Generation X has yet to begin their aggressive saving spree. The table below looks at the borrowing and saving patterns of the demographic cohorts in the US: –

 Excepting the obesity and opioid epidemics, life expectancy will, nonetheless, continue to extend. The Gen Y borrowing binge will not override the aging demographic effect. It’s influence on the inflation of the next decade is likely to be modest (on these grounds alone we will not see the return of double-digit inflation) and the longer term aging trend, bolstered by improvements in healthcare, will return with a vengeance during the 2030’s, undermining the last vestiges of current welfare provisions. Much more saving will be required to pay for the increasing cost of healthcare and pensions. With bond yields of less than 4%, an aging (and hopefully healthier) population will need to continue working well beyond current retirement age in order to cover the shortfall in income.

 Another secular factor which has traditionally kept a lid on inflation has been technology. As Robert Solo famously observed back in 1987, ‘You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.’ Part of the issue is that productivity is measured in currency terms. If the price of a computer remains unchanged for a decade but its capacity to compute increases 10-fold over the same period, absent new buyers of computers, new sales are replacements. In this scenario, the improvement in productivity does not lead to an uptick in economic growth, but it does demonstrably improve our standard of living.

 Looking ahead the impact of machine learning and artificial intelligence is just beginning to be felt. Meanwhile, advances in robotics, always a target of the Luddite fringe, have been significant during the last decade, spurred on by the truncation of global supply chains in the wake of the great financial crisis. This may be to the detriment of frontier economies but the developed world will reap the benefit of cheaper goods.

 When Paul Volcker assumed the helm of the Federal Reserve in the late 1970’s, inflation was eroding any gains from investment in government bonds. Armed with Friedman’s monetary theories, the man who really did remove the punch-bowl, raised short-term rates to above the level of CPI and gradually forced the inflation genie back into its bottle.

 After monetary aggregate targets were abandoned, inflation targeting was widely adopted by many central banks, but, as China joined the WTO (2001) and exported their comparative advantage in labour costs to the rest of the world, those same central bankers’, with Chairman Bernanke in the vanguard, became increasingly petrified by the prospect of price deflation. Memories of the great depression and the monetary constraints of the gold exchange standard were still fresh in their minds. For an economy to expand, it was argued, the supply of money must expand in order to maintain the smooth functioning of markets: a lack of cash would stifle economic growth. Inflation targets of around 2% were deemed appropriate, even as technological and productivity related improvements insured that the prices of many consumer goods actually declined in price.

 Inflation and deflation can be benign or malign. Who does not favour a stock market rally? Yet, who cares to witness their grocery bill spiral into the stratosphere? Who cheers when the latest mobile device is discounted again? But does not panic when the value of their property (on which the loan-to-value is already a consumption-sapping 90%) falls, wiping out all their equity? Blunt inflation targeting is frankly obtuse, but it remains the mandate of, perhaps, the most powerful unelected institutions on the planet.

 When economic historians look back on the period since the collapse of the Bretton Woods agreement, they will almost certainly conclude that the greatest policy mistake, made by central banks, was to disregard asset price inflation in their attempts to stabilise prices. Meanwhile, in the decade ahead, upside breaches of inflation targets will be largely ignored, especially if growth remains anaemic. Central bankers’, it seems, are determined to get behind the curve, they fear the severity of a recession triggered by their own actions. In the new era of open communications and forward guidance they are reticent to increase interest rates, too quickly or by too great a degree, in such a heavily indebted environment. I wrote more about this in November 2018 in The Self-righting Ship – Debt, Inflation and the Credit Cycle: –

 The current level of debt, especially in the developed economies, seems to be acting rather like the self-righting ship. As economic growth accelerates and labour markets tighten, central banks gradually tighten monetary conditions in expectation of inflation. As short-term rates increase, bond yields follow, but, unlike the pattern seen in the higher interest rate era of the 1970’s and 1980’s, the effect of higher bond yields quickly leads to a tempering of credit demand.

 Some commentators will rightly observe that this phenomenon has always existed, but, at the risk of saying ‘this time it’s different,’ the level at which higher bond yields act as a break on credit expansion are much lower today in most developed markets.

 There have been several drivers of disinflation over the past decade including a tightening of bank regulation, increases in capital requirements and relative fiscal austerity. With short-term interest rates near to zero in many countries, governments will find themselves compelled to relax regulatory impediments to credit creation and open the fiscal spigot, at any sign of a recession, after all, central bank QE appears to have reached the limits of its effectiveness. The table below shows the diminishing returns of QE over time: –

 Of course the central banks are not out of ammunition just yet, the Bank of Japan experiment with qualitative easing (they currently purchase ETFs, common stock may be next on their agenda) has yet to be adopted elsewhere and the Federal Reserve has so far resisted the temptation to follow the ECB into corporate bond acquisition.

 For the US bond market the next decade may well see yields range within a relatively narrow band. There is the possibility of new record lows, but the upside is likely to be constrained by the overall indebtedness of both the private and public sector.

Speaking to the India Today reporters she said, “There is a drastic change in my life. Earlier, I used to work as a manual scavenger. It was Dr Bindeshwar Pathak, founder of Sulabh International, who helped me in coming out of that work.”

 Working as a manual scavenger made her feel dirty and an outcast in society. Doing this work also killed her appetite and she didn’t feel like doing anything after coming from work. However, the discriminatory practice was banned in 1993 by ‘The Employment of Manual Scavenging and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act, it is still practised in some parts of India.

 Fortunately, Usha could leave her old life due to the aid of NGO Nai Disha. This NGO transformed her life and helped other women like her. It focuses on empowering women by making them independent and their lives better. It aims to teach them various life-enhancing skills like stitching, Mehendi, and food processing.

1209,0,Gujarati,pqr,"As Americans mourned NBA legend Kobe Bryant on Monday, fans and friends in Italy remembered a lesser-known chapter in his life when he played in their streets as a boy while his father competed in the local basketball league.

 Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash on Sunday, was six when his father Joe moved the family to Italy in 1984 to play seven seasons with four different teams in the centre, south and finally the north.

 The Bryant family first went to Rieti, a town in central Italy, and then moved to Reggio Calabria, in the country’s toe, Cireglio in Tuscany, and finally to Reggio Emilia, in the north.

 “We always kept two eyes on the ball and two eyes on him,” said one of his father’s teammates, Antonio Olivieri, 64.

 He remembered the boy as a ball of energy when the family arrived in Rieti, about 80 km (50 miles) from Rome.

 “Kobe was a kid when he was here in Rieti. I remember Joe always taking him to the gym... he used to climb into the hoops while we were playing,” Olivieri told Reuters.

 “When someone fell on the ground, he came onto the court with a mop to clean up,” he added.

 The local team, NPC Rieti, published a photo of the young Kobe on its Twitter account. “You made us dream,” it wrote. “We are proud to have been the first to see you take to the court. We will never forget Kobe.”

 In a radio interview in 2011, Bryant revealed his affection for the country: “Italy will always be close to my heart,” he said.

 His love for Italy was reflected in the names he chose for his four daughters - Gianna Maria-Onore, who died with him in Sunday’s crash, Natalia Diamante, Bianka Bella and Capri, who was born in June 2019.

 Bryant was especially fond of Reggio Emilia, where he spent two years.

 “I grew up here. I used to ride my bike here. There were all my friends, I have many memories, it’s special,” he said in an interview with BaskeTime magazine in 2016.

 “Forever one of us,” the Reggio Emilia Pallacanestro Reggiana team wrote on Twitter, posting some photos of Bryant when he played for the youth team.

 “Kobe wasn’t known as an NBA star in Reggio Emilia. He was the kid that all the fans knew and saw at the arena when his father played,” said youth coach Andrea Menozzi.

 Bryant’s friends in Cireglio, a small town where the family lived from 1987 to 1989, were struggling to come to terms with his death.

 “One morning at 7, the doorbell rang and I saw Kobe,” said childhood friend Alessia Pierattini, 53, remembering a surprise visit from the Los Angeles Lakers superstar some seven years ago.

 She showed him a photo album that she had put together full of pictures of when he was a boy taking his First Holy Communion at a local Roman Catholic Church.

 “When we left the house after an hour together, people stopped their cars because they wanted to see him. He was open to everybody and took photos in the streets (with them),” she said. She added that Kobe had told her that he wanted to bring his daughters to live in Italy.

 “I want them to experience what I felt as a child, a reality that does not exist in America,” he told Pierattini.

1212,0,Hindi,abc,"When I say compact sedan from Hyundai, well, you might be thinking of the Hyundai Xcent. Well, that car has a successor now, in the form of the Hyundai Aura which, if you haven’t made out already, is based on the Grand i10 Nios. But there are new things that are being offered with this car to make it lucrative to the compact sedan buyer in India. So we took it out for a drive to find out what are these new features, how is it to drive and to find out the answer to the big question – whether this is going to be worth your money?

 Let’s start with the design of the Hyundai Aura. While from the front it looks similar to the Grand i10 Nios, it does get a redesigned bumper and different detailing to the grille, which has been given a silver bezel. You also get the same swept-back projector headlamps along with projector fog lamps but perhaps the biggest differentiator from the front is the fact that the Aura gets twin Boomerang-shaped LED DRLs instead of one that you get on the Grand i10 Nios.

 Coming to the sides, the Aura gets newly designed alloy wheels which look fantastic and the car sports a coupe-like roofline that tapers towards the boot, which itself has a pinched-up look making it look properly sporty. The C-Pillar has been given a gloss-black finish to give the Aura a floating roof design.

 Coming to the back, it gets Z-shaped LED tail lamps which get a chrome garnish in between to make them look connected.

 While from the front, the Aura looks good, it is from the sides and the rear where the design can come across as a bit polarizing. However, we can say that the Aura does look better in the flesh than in the pictures.

 Coming to the inside of the Aura, the moment you step in, the first thing that will come to your mind is the Grand i10 Nios as the cabin is almost identical in terms of design. However, Hyundai has taken the effort to give it its own treatment. Like the seats now get a different texture and also, the dash uses bronze inserts which look a lot better. You still get the good bits like the honeycomb pattern on the dash, doors and around the gear lever.

 The use of lighter shades inside the cabin make it look upmarket and premium, however, the cabin and the seat upholstery will require special care as time goes to maintain a clean look. You still have an ample amount of storage compartments all across the cabin. In terms of features, the Aura gets things like wireless charging for the top-spec variant, automatic climate control, a semi-digital instrument cluster that shows pretty much everything you need to know and there is also an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system that has a good touch response and is intuitive to use. It also supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. What’s new with the Aura is that the top-end petrol variants also come with Cruise control.

 So for those seated at the front, it’s a nice cabin space to be in. And the same goes for those seated at the back as well.

 Adjusting the driver seat to my height of 5’10, I still had a good amount of legroom, knee room, shoulder room and a decent amount of headroom. This is one of the most spacious cabins in its segment in terms of width and you won’t have any problems having three people sit at the back. Also, the under-thigh support is nice too. But, what’s new in the Aura is that now you get an armrest as well.

 But coming to the all-important part, which is the driving experience.

 Hyundai is offering the Aura with three engine options. There is a 1.2-litre petrol engine that is offered with a choice of 5-speed manual or a 5-speed AMT gearbox. Then there is the 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine which is the most powerful of the lot that comes with only a 5-speed manual gearbox option and finally, there’s the drivetrain that we drove – 1.2-litre diesel engine with a 5-speed manual gearbox. And yes, this gets an AMT gearbox option too.

 The diesel engine makes 75 PS of power and 190 Nm of torque. But what’s special about this engine is the fact that this is a BS-VI emission-norm compliant motor. This means that come April 1, 2020, the Hyundai Aura will be one of the few diesel-engine powered compact sedans that will be on sale in India. As for the driving bit, the engine is refined and has a healthy spread of power and torque across the RPM band.

 In case of the quick overtakes, you won’t feel the need to downshift every time. We also found the suspension setup coped well with low-speed bumps and had a stable ride at highways speeds as well. The Aura feels even better at city speeds thanks to the light clutch and steering that makes it easy to tackle city traffic. All in all, the Aura leaves a positive first impression at almost all fronts.

 So to wrap it up, having spent the day driving around in this car, it offers a familiar driving experience, which is to say that this is a good car to drive around in.

1213,0,Tamil ,xyz,"The government is planning a revamp of the insolvency process to make the mechanism simpler and attractive for buyers of stressed assets, according to a senior official.

 It’s considering tax concessions for such buyers, the official said on the condition of anonymity as details aren’t public yet. Some of the concessions being considered are waiver of stamp duty, registration fees, past customs dues and GST imposed on sale of some assets, the official said.

 The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India is working on the proposals and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is expected to announce some of these concessions in the Union Budget 2020-21 to be tabled on Feb. 1, he said.

 According to Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, all creditors, including tax authorities, have to submit their claims to a resolution professional once a company is admitted for insolvency. If the plan doesn’t include tax claims, the authorities challenge it at the National Company Law Tribunal. And if their claims are dismissed by the NCLT, they can challenge the tribunal’s order.

 The government is working on guidelines for tax authorities so that they don’t challenge the resolution plan approved by the NCLT, the person cited earlier said.

 A framework is also under discussion to prevent the tax authorities from coming up with a pervasive interpretation of the law that leads to a high tax liability for the buyer of a stressed asset, he said.

 Besides, the government wants a clear policy for its departments to file claims for companies under IBC, the person said, adding that tax authorities may be given directions to stop filing adverse claims after a transaction is completed. The government intends to protect new buyers from such claims, the official said.

 There’s lack of clarity whether a bidder is entitled to pay tax dues, and each NCLT takes its own view while deciding on such matters, according to Babu Sivaprakasam, a partner at Economic Laws Practice. Framing a suitable policy and guidelines to government departments and agencies for filing timely claims when a company goes into insolvency will help the resolution process, he said.

 There are lots of light to medium intensity exercises that help you to lose weight easily. We need to understand that weight loss happens through the loss of fat. An individual should choose the exercise through an intelligent balancing of the percentage of fat that you would like to shed and the total calories that you want to burn. Here are some exercises that can help you to shed that extra flab:

 Walking

 This is by far the most simple and oft overlooked weight loss mechanism. According to trainers, the amount of fat lost through this exercise is around 55%. But this obviously does not entail that you can stroll around to lose weight. The intensity of effort is all that matters. Brisk walking for a long duration can help you to burn calories and shed the flab as well. The most interesting point is that anyone having any sort of health condition can start this exercise with ease.

 Light Jogging or Aerobic Exercise

 Aerobic classes can do well to people who want to lose weight consistently and fast. Just in a single session a lot of energy gets burnt. There is another advantage in this option. People who are not enough motivated can benefit by joining in and gather motivation by working out with the fitter members of the class. In this exercise the carbohydrates provide the main fuel for the intense workout and it actually pushes the percentage of fat that actually burns down, which can be as low as 30%.

 Running

 You need to run 7 miles on an average to benefit from this exercise. This will basically help you to burn over 10 calories every minute. Running is a totally different type of exercise that uses up the carbohydrates and results in the building of muscles. Trained runners actually have their muscles evolved to this type of intense exercise and their utilisation of oxygen is much better. This results in their acceleration of their potential to burn their regular fat when they go for a high level of physical exertion.

 Sprinting or Weight Training

 This falls under the category of anaerobic exercise. Carbohydrates are exclusive sources of energy for this type of exercises. One can lose weight effectively by burning a huge amount of total calories that follows from the repeated performance of the movements in an intense manner. Trainers often suggest short intervals in order to prevent possible muscle fatigue. People often go for aerobic exercises during these intervals.

 Alternatively, if you want to lose weight, experts suggest the exercisers to perform aerobic exercise for the entire duration of session so that the total calories that get burnt are much higher. The interesting feature of this sort of exercise schedule is that even after the session is long over, the metabolism level that has increased in the body is still retained. So you stand to lose weight when you are not working too! It is the fat burning potential that is the main beneficiary factor of this exercise program.

 Starting on a highly volatile note, the 30-share BSE index swung nearly 200 points in early trade before quoting 97.09 points or 0.24 per cent higher at 41,252.21.

 Similarly, the broader NSE was trading 29.20 points, or 0.24 per cent, up at 12,148.20.

 HDFC was the top gainer in the Sensex pack, rallying over 2 per cent after the country’s largest pureplay mortgage lender reported a near four-fold growth in net profit at Rs 8,372.5 crore for the three months to December as against Rs 2,113.8 crore in the same period last fiscal year.

 Hero MotoCorp, M&M, Maruti, Sun Pharma, SBI, Bajaj Auto and HDFC Bank were also trading with gains.

 Top losers included PowerGrid, Nestle India, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, NTPC and HUL, rising up to 1.24 per cent.

 According to analysts, strong earnings of select bluechips lifted benchmarks. Broader markets continued to outperform signalling that investors are hoping for an economic revival in the upcoming budget.

 However, volatility remained amid a global selloff triggered by concerns over the impact of rapidly-spreading coronavirus on world economies, they added.

1222,0,Gujarati,abc,"Actor Kunal Kemmu says the sequel to his 2013 zom-com hit “Go Goa Gone” has been going through logistical issues and hence the project couldn’t take off over the past few years.

 Asked when shooting for the film would possibly begin, Kunal replied: “It’s my question, too, because I have also read the announcement. Other than that, I don’t have any knowledge. They (makers of the film) announced ‘Go Goa Gone 2‘ twice in the last three years (laughs). There are logistical issues. Till the time we don’t start shooting for the film, I will not believe it, because in the past two years I have been excited about that film on different levels and it’s very close to my heart.

 Kunal was interacting with the media while promoting his upcoming film “Malang” in Mumbai. Incidentally, he had written the dialogues for “Go Goa Gone“, which featured Kunal with his brother-in-law Saif Ali Khan, Vir Das and Anand Tiwari. The film followed three men whose Goa holiday turns into a zombie nightmare. The film was directed by Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK.

 According to the makers, the sequel will take off from the point where the original ended. All the actors are expected to reprise their characters.

1223,0,Gujarati,xyz,"Budding Bollywood actor Avinash Tiwary, who was seen in the Netflix original anthology “Ghost Stories” earlier this month, feels mainstream media does not give enough coverage to a new actor from a non-film background unless there is a paid arrangement involved.

 “When it comes to actors from outside of the film industry unless they go through the paid media, they do not get enough coverage. When I bagged ‘Ghost Stories’, I was so happy for obvious reasons. It is the dream of any actor to work with a celebrated filmmaker like Karan Johar. However, from the day the film was screened to the reviews, I did not get enough mentions. My pictures were clicked at the red carpet but not published enough in newspapers,” Avinash told IANS.

 After 15 years of struggle in the film industry now, Avinash Tiwary has become used to with the situation, he says, and shares the reason why he feels disheartened: “My parents were here and the film released on January 1. They truly thought that after so many years of hard work, they will see my pictures everywhere in the newspapers and will get a chance to read about me. They saw pictures all my co-actors and not enough of mine. They said, ‘beta, tumhare toh tasveer bhi nahi hain (son, there aren’t even any pictures of yours).”

 He has no complaints on the constant struggle that every actor goes through, but he noted, about outsiders with little or no support system in the industry: “When our films release, the media does not show enough curiosity about us. Look at Viineet Kumar, the brilliant actor of ‘Mukkabaaz’. Do we talk about him enough? On the other hand, with ‘gym looks’, ‘airport looks’ and ‘coming out of restaurant looks’, social media is flooded with the pictures of some actors. The media creates visibility for them. I say, even we exist!”

 “Having said that, I know that the media will start talking about me when more films of mine come out. Till then, I have to wait,” added the actor, who had a starring role in the Imtiaz Ali’s 2018 presentation “Laila Majnu” and who also appeared in the 2017 release, “Tu Hai Mera Sunday”.

 Despite everything, Avinash has a sufficiently packed diary for now. “I have completed shooting for ‘Bulbul’, which is a fantasy drama. It is a Netflix original and I cannot talk about it extensively. I have shared screen space with Tripti Dimri with whom I worked together in ‘Laila Majnu’. I also have an interesting role in ‘The Girl On The Train’,” Avinash signed off.

1224,0,Telugu,xyz,"Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee on Monday suggested that the government should consider bringing back the wealth tax given the kind of inequality present in India. “In general, more redistribution makes perfect sense to me,” he said at the Kolkata Literary Meet, according to The Telegraph.

 He, however, added that he does not expect it to happen right now. “I hear all the vibes about a tax cut for the middle classes,” said Banerjee. “I don’t think that is where the leverage points are. To be honest I am less worried about budget deficit, it’s never been what it claims to be…. I think government can do better.”

 Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharam is scheduled to present the Union Budget on February 1. The wealth tax was first put in place in 1957. However, the Narendra Modi government had scrapped the wealth tax in 2015 because of a high cost of collections and a low yield. Total wealth tax collected in 2013-’14 was only Rs 1,008 crore. The wealth tax was replaced with an additional surcharge of 2% on the super rich with a taxable income of over Rs 1 crore annually.

 The Indian-American economist said India could be passing through a phase of recession but there was no way to know it. “We are just picking up the symptoms,” he said. “The statistical apparatus is incapable of capturing short-term data on the informal sector.”

 “If you ask me, could we be in a recession? There is nothing in data that says we could not be in a recession,” said Banerjee, according to IANS. He, however, cited the example of sale of two-wheelers, which have been hit by a slowdown . “It is the informal sector that buys the two-wheelers,” he added.

 Banerjee said the first reaction to an economic problem like demand slowdown was to cut corporate tax. “To me, it’s like we are in a time warp,” he said. “We do not see where we are. The corporate sector is actually sitting on cash and not doing much with it because there is no demand. We have a mindset of making policies, which are based on some model of economics where all the dynamism is to be provided by the rich. This doesn’t seem to be true.”

 The economist said that the priority of the government should be on refinancing the banking sector, but warned that it will take time to yield results. “The banking sector is in doldrums,” he said. “It needs huge funding by the government. The Centre should also look at infrastructure sector funding.”

 The growth rate of the Indian economy has plummeted over the last three years. In the second quarter of 2019-’20, the Gross Domestic Product recorded a six-year-low growth rate of 4.5%. The government has predicted that India will grow at just 5% for 2019-’20, the lowest in 11 years. Meanwhile, retail inflation rose to a five-and-half year high of 7.35% in December 2019. The government had in September last year slashed the corporate tax rate for domestic firms from 35% to 22%.

 Banerjee also favoured the central government’s move to privatise public sector undertakings like Air India. “I would love to sell out the prestigious PSUs,” he said when asked on the Centre’s disinvestment plan, according to The Indian Express. On Monday, the Centre said it was for planning to sell its entire stake in Air India. The move has been criticised by Congress leaders Kapil Sibal and Sandeep Dixit as well as Bharatiya Janata Party leader Subramanian Swamy.

 The professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said “the fringes of the ruling party” was trying “to demonise a population”. He said in India, like in the United States, the minorities were not anywhere close to being dominant. “I don’t think there is any real fear that there is going to be a Muslim takeover of India,” he said, according to The Telegraph. “Whenever these fears are stoked, you could imagine a context when these are two equal groups, and you worry about the other group becoming too powerful. This is just not realistic here… [it] is constructing a narrative that has no basis in reality.”

 Banerjee said there was no evidence that migrants depress low-income wages. “People have this idea [migrants will take away their jobs] because they have learnt economics in high school,” said the Nobel laureate. “One of the dangers of learning economics at high school is [that] you learn it half way. So you learn that there is a supply curve and a demand curve. And when the supply curve moves, more people come in and the price goes down, (and) wages go down. What people forget is that when people migrate they don’t live on air. They buy stuff. So you know it also moves demand.”

 Banerjee said “economic migrants” are enterprising people. “They tend to actually add a lot to the economy,” he added. “...When a lot of people come, you end up in a slightly different job. You become the manager for these people, the newcomers; you start a restaurant to feed them. So, people actually reallocate to absorb them.”

1225,0,Tamil ,abc,"Senior advocates Senior lawyers Kapil Sibal, Indira Jaisingh and Dushyant Dave have refuted claims that they had received money from the Popular Front of India in connection with the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, The Times of India reported on Tuesday. They threatened to take legal action for unsubstantiated allegations, and against any person/media organisation who tried to tarnish their reputation.

 The Enforcement Directorate had written a letter to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs alleging that Congress leader Sibal, and lawyers Jaising and Dave received payments from the Popular Front of India, The Indian Express reported on Monday. However, the letter did not mention that these funds were received for supporting protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

 “I completely and vehemently deny having received any money from PFI at any point of time, or receiving any money from any person or organisation in relation to anti-CAA protests,” Jaisingh said in a statement.

 My statement denying receipt of money from PFI in relation to anti CAA protests or for any other reason or purpose whatsoever.  @PTI_News @ZeeNews @ndtv @CNNnews18 @LiveLawIndia @barandbench @AltNews @scroll_in @thewire_in @the_hindu pic.twitter.com/HM1ECWDmxI

 The Enforcement Directorate had claimed that at least Rs 120 crore was deposited in the accounts of the Popular Front of India in Western Uttar Pradesh after the Citizenship Amendment Act was passed by Parliament on December 11 last year, PTI reported.

 The Enforcement Directorate alleged that scrutiny of a Popular Front of India account with the Syndicate Bank branch on Moovar Road in Kozhikode, Kerala, revealed that payments of Rs 3.77 crore were made to various individuals and persons. This includes payments to Sibal (Rs 77 lakh), Jaising (Rs 4 lakh), Dave (Rs 11 lakh), Popular Front of India Kashmir (Rs 1.65 crore), New Jyothi Group (1.17 crore), and a person called Abdul Samad (Rs 3.10 lakh). Samad is an accused against whom the National Investigation Agency has filed a chargesheet in a case related to a hawala network funding terror activities in India.

 In her statement, Jaising added: “The note showing details of transaction from the PFI account alleged to be made to me does not contain any signature or date, nor does it contain the name of the agency from where it has originated, and is therefore wholly unreliable.” The advocate warned that she would take “serious civil as well as criminal legal action” against persons or media houses who try to tarnish her reputation.

 Sibal said he received Rs 77 lakh as litigation fee for appearing in the Supreme Court between August 2017 and March 2018 for Hadiya in a case related to her marriage with Shafiya Jahan, reported IANS. He added that the money had nothing to do with the protests against the citizenship law. “In all matters in which I have appeared in the Supreme Court challenging constitutionality of the CAA, I have not raised, till date, any invoice,” he told The Times of India. “Any insinuations made to besmirch my name and defame me will be taken seriously.”

 Dave said it was known to the public that the PFI collected money for Hadiya’s legal battle. “It is very unfortunate that the issue is being raised now when the PFI had itself in 2018 made a statement that it had spent a total of Rs 99,52,324 on fighting Hadiya case,” he told the daily. “I appeared in the case thrice and one bill was raised for the appearance on October 9, 2017 for which we received the fee on October 30.”

 Hadiya’s marriage to a Muslim man, Shafin Jahan, was annulled by the Kerala High Court in May 2017. Her father had alleged that his daughter had been brainwashed and forced to convert to Islam. But the top court held that marriage and intimacy of personal relationships were at the core of India’s plurality and that the state could not be allowed to make “inroads into this extremely personal space”.

 Popular Front of India General Secretary Mohammad Ali Jinnah claimed that his organisation had not funded the protests against the amended Citizenship Act. He also said payments shown against the names of Sibal, Dave and Jaising were made in connection with the Hadiya marriage case, and were publicly declared.

 The Popular Front of India claimed that it “fully complies with the law of the land, and allegation of Rs 120 crore transferred from [its] accounts just before CAA protest is totally baseless…Popular Front of India does not have any wing or branch in Jammu and Kashmir”.

 The Citizenship Amendment Act provides citizenship to refugees from six minority religious communities from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan, provided they have lived in India for six years and entered the country by December 31, 2014. The Act has been widely criticised for excluding Muslims. Twenty-six people died in last month’s protests against the law – all in the BJP-ruled states of Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Assam.

1227,0,English,abc,"Seven-time Grand Slam winner Mats Wilander has urged Nick Kyrgios to play more matches on the Australian Open’s centre court if he’s serious about winning his home Grand Slam.

 Wilander said the Australian needs to get used to playing at Rod Laver Arena, rather than sticking to his favoured Melbourne Arena, a smaller but rowdier venue.

 Kyrgios played his first three matches at Melbourne Arena but then lost to world number one Rafael Nadal at Rod Laver Arena late Monday, going down in four sets.

 “Something that goes along with being a great player is setting yourself up for failure or success,” Wilander told AFP.

 “So if you set yourself up for playing those matches on Melbourne Arena because that’s where you think you have the best chance to win, you’re clearly not thinking about winning the tournament, nor is the tournament organisation.”

 Kyrgios, with his booming serve and flamboyant nature, is one of tennis’s greatest talents but in seven trips to Melbourne Park, his best result is reaching the quarter-finals in 2015.

 It’s a pattern repeated elsewhere as the 24-year-old, so often hampered by his volatile temper, has only reached one other Grand Slam quarter-final, at Wimbledon in 2015.

 Kyrgios, who was handed a 16-week suspended ban in September, has cut a notably calmer figure in Melbourne but he always looked second-favourite against Nadal.

 “He comes in here (Rod Laver Arena) and he gets neutralised and he gets stale and he gets tired,” Wilander said.

 “Emotionally it’s too draining to suddenly not have the crowd behind you and play for you only when you don’t get applause for drop shots or tweeners or ace on second serve.

 “You’re not setting yourself up as one of the guys that believe they can win.”

 Wilander said Kyrgios is a “breath of fresh air, brilliant tennis player”.

 “I would love to see Nick Kyrgios turn it on and be one of the best players in the world. But there’s a lot more that you have to do to be considered one of them,” said the Swede.

 He added: “I have no feeling for Nick Kyrgios until he wins a tennis match where not everybody is rooting for him, and it’s 50-50, and it’s one of the best players in the world, and he goes through the whole match, wins it and backs it up the next day.

 “He is a great talent in terms of physical ability but unfortunately physical talent is not the only talent you need.”

1231,0,Gujarati,xyz,"Given the obsession to limit the dressed up fiscal deficit figure and unable to think of better responses to the growth slowdown than tax cuts, it is more than likely that sound economic management and ways to address the intensifying stagflation would not be the focus of the Finance Minister’s attention when presenting the next Budget.

 Objective number one is likely to be a show of fiscal prudence. But, given the recessionary environment, that alone would not do, since there must be some indication of further efforts to stimulate the economy and trigger a turnaround. That needs enhanced spending.

 Faced with these twin objectives, the government would have to project substantially higher receipts, that can match increased expenditures without flouting its own conservative fiscal stance, signalled by tight control over the fiscal deficit. This is bound to set off a scramble for resources, real or imaginary.

 Some would be extracted from the RBI, though having cleared out accumulated “surplus” reserves in fiscal 2019-20, the sum that would be available from this source in 2020-21 would be lower than in the preceding fiscal year.

 Non-debt capital receipts from privatisation appear a source that the Finance Minister can turn to because of the projected large shortfall in privatisation receipts in 2019-20. If the opportunity identified for 2019-20 remains unutilised, then tapping that source should be an obvious option for 2020-21. However, the shortfall in 2019-20 raises a number of questions.

 As per plans revealed in bits and pieces, the principal means of raising large resources from privatisation was to be strategic sale. The Cabinet had cleared plans for a large stake sale along with transfer of management control in BPCL, Container Corporation of India and Air India and had identified a set of steel and other projects that could be put through the same process, all with the primary aim of raising budgetary resources. In fact, in instances like BPCL, the conventional arguments of negative profits and inefficiency characterising public sector entities warranting privatisation did not apply.

 While these were among the advertised plans, in actual fact a significant chunk of the resources raised so far was from the sale of public sector enterprise equity-linked exchange-traded funds. Besides this, money came in through IPOs by IRCTC and Rail Vikas Nigam and an offer for sale of equity from RITES.

 This limited mobilisation suggests that there was some set of factors holding back the effort to garner resources through strategic sales and wholesale privatisation. In some cases, like Air India, the accumulated debt and liabilities of enterprises were so huge that private buyers were unwilling to take over, unless the government cleaned the books. But for a cash-strapped government looking for resources any effort to neutralise debt with its money prior to a sale hardly made sense.

 The second reason why the privatisation effort may have stalled is the state of the economy, which could have affected the government’s assessment of its ability to ensure sales of public assets at prices that seemed reasonable, let alone lucrative. Finally, the same state of the economy may be just discouraging private investors who still had access to the required cash to hold back on making a bid for these enterprises.

 The prospect that the RBI and privatisation may not be major sources of funds, has set off a scramble for resources, real or imaginary.

 Despite the recession, the government has claimed that it would be able to significantly increase tax collection in the remaining months. The Revenue Department of the Finance Ministry has reportedly set the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs a target of GST revenue collection of Rs.3.55 lakh crore over the last three months of fiscal 2019-20. Set at Rs. 1.15 lakh crore for January and February 2020, and Rs. 1.25 lakh crore for March 2020, this amounts to an average of Rs. 1.18 lakh crore over the three months. That seems near impossible since the average achieved over the first nine months of the financial year was just marginally above Rs.1 lakh crore.

 But the fact that the government can set such targets shows that it would be willing to inflate estimates presented in the Budget. The claim is that the tax authorities would come down heavily on those availing “fake” input credits, of which they claim to have evidence. What is unclear is if such evidence was available, why did the government have to wait till this late stage to start the process of extracting taxes due from tax law violators.

 Since the Budget is being presented on February 1, which is two months before the financial year actually ends, revenue and expenditure figures for the financial year as a whole are estimates. Those estimates should be based on trends in the first 9-10 months of the current financial year and full-year figures for recent years gone by. But if targets can be set that are not based on what the trends suggest on what the tax department has been mandated to do, then it is possible to convert such ‘targets’ into estimates of revenue that would be realised. And if estimates can be inflated for the current financial year that can be easily done for the next as well.

 Finally, there is the possibility of not bringing into the budget expenditures that must be accounted for. As in the recent past, allocations to agencies like the FCI can be held back, forcing them to borrow to meet what should be budget financed expenditures. Such practices have been adopted by previous governments as well, but reliance on them has increased considerably. Off-budget transactions of that kind reduce the ‘declared’ fiscal deficit to GDP ratio, but unfairly burden public institutions with debt that arises merely because they are implementing central government policies.

 Put together, these measures would amount to little more than playing with figures, while the economy continues its downward slide. But that is the price to be paid for being obsessed with ‘business-friendly” policies while believing that politically the economy does not matter since Hindutva attracts voters.

 Shah said at an election meeting in Rithala in northwest Delhi that Kejriwal and Congress leader Rahul Gandhi were against the construction of Ram temple and the repeal of Article 370 and that they did not care about the country’s image and soldiers. He said that the opposition is afraid that the decision will spoil their vote bank.

 He asked, “Are you their vote bank? Where is their vote bank? The crowd responded to this,” Shaheenbagh”.

 Shah said, “I want to ask Kejriwal whether he is in favor of arresting Sharjeel Imam or not? Are you with the people of Shaheenbagh or not, please tell the people of Delhi.” Imam was one of the early organizers of the protest in Shaheenbagh.

 In reply to this, Kejriwal alleged that the Bhagwa party (BJP) is doing ‘Dirty Politics’ on Shaheenbagh. He said that the responsibility of the law and order of the national capital is the responsibility of Center and “If they are saying that they need permission from me, I am giving permission, remove the road jam in an hour.”

For those who follow Selena would know that the album is also a closure of a painful chapter for Selena. Recently in an interview with NPRs Lulu Garcia-Navarro, the singer revealed what inspired her song from the album and also opened up about the emotional abuse that she had to go through during her tumultuous relationship with Justin Bieber.

 Selena in the interview revealed that she is proud of the song Lose You to Love Me, which is said to be the most emotional song from the album. Selena said, Im very proud of it. It has a different meaning to me now from when I wrote it. I felt I didnt get a respectful closure, and I had accepted that, but I know I needed some way to just say a few things that I wish I had said.

 When asked if the song is a breakup song, Selena said she doesnt classify it as a hateful breakup song. Its a song that is saying — I had something beautiful and I would never deny that it wasnt that, she explained and added, It was very difficult and Im happy its over.

 Selena was explicitly asked if she is saying goodbye to her ex Justin Bieber in the song, Selena replied, You had to get the name in, I get it.

 Selena also revealed in the interview that she found strength while working on the song. Its dangerous to stay in a victim mentality. And Im not being disrespectful, I do feel I was a victim to certain abuse, she commented. Selena revealed she referred to emotional abuse, explaining further she added, Yes, and I think that its something that — I had to find a way to understand it as an adult. And I had to understand the choices I was making. As much as I definitely dont want to spend the rest of my life talking about this, I am really proud that I can say I feel the strongest Ive ever felt and Ive found a way to just walk through it with as much grace as possible.

1236,0,Hindi,pqr,"The Union Budget to be presented on 1 February has been taken to be the next big thing that can happen to reshape the prospects of the economy. Starting with monetary policy and moving along a series of sector-specific policies, the needle has come back to fiscal policy to offer solutions.

 So far the focus has been on the supply side when the problem appears to be on the demand side. In a limited manner, the government did lower the corporate tax rate to provide an incentive to industry to invest on the demand side, but admittedly this will take time to work out. A more direct attack is required and within the realm of the Budget, capex can be the pivot.

 Representational image. Reuters

 When the suggestion is made that the government should spend more, it is assumed that the focus is on increasing capex which will be directed towards roads, railways, power, ports, etc., which will, in turn, generate jobs directly. Cutting corporate tax rate or making funds cheaper is part of the plan.

 However, for the tax cut to work, it has to be invested and the government has no control over what companies do. Similarly, the RBI can cut rates aggressively but the response of companies cannot be forced as they are based on demand conditions.

 Capex injects funds directly into the spending stream and is hence superior to even direct cash transfers where the action of the beneficiary can never be guessed accurately.

 So how important or large is this capex? The table below provides some time perspective of capex of the central government and related ratios.

 While capital expenditure is aggregate outlay on the capital side, the effective capex excludes loans given by the central government and outlays on defence. The table provides valuable insights on the importance of capex.

 First, it has been increasing at a compound rate of 10.3 percent per annum in the last six years which is the same as that of overall size of the Budget. Therefore, there has been a tendency to keep the rate of growth in capex on par. This is important because it can be an indicator of what kind of growth can be expected in the ordinary course of budgeting for FY21. Under normal conditions, if the overall size of the Budget increases to say Rs 30.65 lakh crore, effective capex would be 2.28 lakh crore.

 Second, the effective capital expenditure which is what is really spent on non-defence non-loans purpose and includes the physical infrastructure that is created is around 60 percent of total capital expenditure of the government and an improvement from the range of 43-47 percent in 2013-14 and 2014-15. The difference is the amount deployed for defence and loans and advances given to other entities which are mainly state governments. The defence needs to be excluded because normally such expenditure would be import-oriented and would not add to investment within the country. Loans by definition would be capex accounted for by states which however may also be used for repayment as money is fungible.

 Third, as a proportion of total expenditure effective capex has been in the region of 7.5-8 percent in the last five years which is definitely higher than the 5-6 percent maintained earlier.

 Fourth, the same is just about 1 percent of the GDP and quite clearly has been elevated in the last five years where it has been higher than in the earlier years. Therefore, the BJP-led government has been quite aggressive on this front to ensure that capex is progressively higher.

 Against this background, the pertinent ideas which come to mind are two-fold. The first is what can be the level of expenditure this time assuming that the government goes in for a stimulus. The fiscal deficit ratio will be important here as an increase in capex beyond 10 percent—which broadly could be the number taken for the size of the Budget—too, would mean a higher deficit will be generated. The ratio was targeted at 3.3 percent for FY20 which can be breached and move towards 3.8-4 percent mark as being the revised ratio. This will be a call that the government has to take.

 Intuitively, an additional 1 percent fiscal deficit ratio would be around Rs 2-2.1 lakh crore that can be incurred. The critical thing of course is whether or not the other numbers on revenue and mandatory expenditure work out as projected or not. Assuming that the other numbers will be on course, the additional Rs 2 lakh crore can be used for effective capex and the fiscal deficit ratio would increase from 3.3 percent (Budget 2019-20) to 4.3 percent (Budget 20120-21). The question is whether or not the government is prepared for this higher level given that the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management talks of movement towards 3 percent with slippage of 0.5 percent being tolerated in difficult times.

 The second set of issues revolves around the question of whether this will really help to revive the economy.

 The fundamental question is whether a sum of Rs 2 lakh crore of capex as of today can galvanise an economy of Rs 204 lakh crore (for 2019-20)? As a corollary, if this increases to Rs 4 lakh crore, with a higher fiscal deficit, will the course of GDP growth be very different?

 Here the response should be guarded. An increase in capex will definitely increase spending more effectively than any tax cut which depends on the beneficiaries’ response as such an action is direct. As a proportion of expected incremental GDP of around Rs 20 lakh crore in FY21, the big push has to still come from the private sector to move the ‘elephant’. This additional Rs 2 lakh crore can at best create the starting points which have to be joined by the private players.

1237,0,Hindi,pqr,"If senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders had left us with the capacity to be shocked, we would indeed be profoundly shaken by the fact that a member of the Union Council of Ministers led a crowd he was addressing on Monday in raising a chant exhorting people to Shoot the countrys traitors.

 A BJP candidate for the impending Assembly election in Delhi, Kapil Mishra, led a procession on 21 December, 2019 in which an abbreviated version of this chant was also raised. He was not sanctioned, though his recidivist bouts of incitement led the Election Commission (EC) to slap him gently on the wrist – banning him from campaigning for 48 hours, beginning 5 pm on Saturday (thus, expired now) – for saying that the Delhi election was like a contest between India and Pakistan.

 Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur was the offending leader on Monday, raising the chant while campaigning for a BJP candidate in Rithala, Delhi. Considering the fact that a candidate for the elections got away practically unscathed after making incendiary statements serially, it is unclear what the EC can do to Thakur. At best, it can ban him from campaigning altogether, but that will probably neither greatly inconvenience him nor the party.

 Dilip Ghosh, the president of the West Bengal unit of the BJP, had made a similar statement, which he refused to retract after it provoked an outcry. He had said on 12 January that people in West Bengal who were destroying government property while protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, and the National Register of Citizens (NCR) should be shot like dogs as they had been in Uttar Pradesh and Assam. He refused to recant despite criticism from members of his own party and a statement issued by the Uttar Pradesh government to the effect that it had not shot anyone.

 File image of Union minister Anurag Thakur. AFP

 What ought to be done in such cases lies in the bailiwick of the police. This chant is clearly an incitement to violence, even murder. The police can, therefore, slap an accessory-before-the-fact charge on these leaders. The Delhi Police had actually lodged a first information report (FIR) against Mishra for the India-Pakistan tweet. On the face of it, there is no reason to desist from lodging FIRs against Mishra and Thakur for the shoot them slogans. Ghosh has been booked by the West Bengal Police.

 The larger point, however, is the phenomenon itself of senior BJP leaders making statements that do not behoove them. Take the rhetorical trajectory that began with the formulation of the dangerous, though utterly vacuous, phrase tukde, tukde gang. The phrase gained currency in 2016, when then Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union president Kanhaiya Kumar, along with two other students, was accused of raising anti-national slogans at an event organised by them. They were charged, inter alia, with sedition. In the absence of evidence, the cases against the three former students have languished.

 But these two phrases — tukde, tukde gang and anti-national — have become part of the BJPs rhetorical arsenal. They are used indiscriminately to attack as unpatriotic and even traitorous anyone and everyone who does not embrace the viciously exclusivist and majoritarian ideological frame of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its parivar, which includes preeminently the BJP.

 Thus, a number of leaders have branded the protesters currently demonstrating peacefully at Delhis Shaheen Bagh and scores of Shaheen Baghs all over India. It was Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who, most recently, accused the Shaheen Bagh protesters of being, by default, part of the tukde, tukde gang.

 A significant section of the protesters at Shaheen Bagh and elsewhere are, however, apolitical women who are participating in a protest for the first time in their lives because they genuinely fear that a toxic combination of the CAA and the NCR will rob many Muslims, alongside many poor and indigent people regardless of their denominational status, of their citizenship and wreak great damage to constitutional democracy.

 Britain faces a crucial choice on Tuesday over whether to allow Chinas Huawei Technologies to build its next-generation wireless networks. The decision has implications for the countrys diplomatic relations with the United States, which is pushing allies to shun the Chinese company over cyber-security concerns. And Britains choice will feed into a wider battle between the US and China over technological supremacy that has seen the worlds two biggest economies engage in a damaging trade war.

 Britains National Security Council is poised to decide whether to allow Huawei to build parts of its new high-speed cellular network known as 5G, an infrastructure program the country sees as critical to its economic future. But Huawei has come under scrutiny because of worries that communist leaders in Beijing could, under Chinas 2017 national intelligence law, compel the company to carry out cyber espionage. The United States has been pressing allies to shun Huawei and has threatened to cut off intelligence cooperation with Britain if it gives Huawei access. Supporters say Britain needs Huaweis expertise and that security issues can be managed. The company denies it would give data access to the Chinese government.

 Days away from leaving the European Union and desperately needing to secure its future outside of the trading bloc, Britain is now caught in the middle of a geopolitical battle between the US and China — both important trading partners.

 Prime Minister Boris Johnsons government finds itself in the awkward position of risking the fury of its closest ally at just the moment it really needs President Donald Trumps administration to quickly strike a trade deal. Britain is also loathe to insult Beijing. The UK made a point of courting Chinese investment with the State Visit of Xi Jinping in 2015, a gilded affair meant to underline the dawn of a new era.

 Huawei.

 Johnson hinted Monday that he wants to thread a middle route. “The way forward for us clearly is to have a system that delivers for people in this country the kind of consumer benefits that they want through 5G technology or whatever, but does not in any way compromise our critical national infrastructure, our security or jeopardise our ability to work together with other intelligence powers around the world,” he said. “We are going to come up with a solution that enables us to achieve both those objectives and thats the way forward.

 Dont be fooled by the name. The fifth generation of cellular networks is not merely an upgrade from existing 4G wireless network technology. Its billed as a radical transformation delivering ultrafast download speeds combined with a vastly reduced signal lag — the slight delay that occurs between, say, tapping out a command on your phone and getting a response. The other difference is that it will be built into thousands of new devices, like thermostats and sensors in medical devices. The aim is for 5G to be instrumental for self-driving cars or for telemedicine, allowing doctors to control robots in remote surgery on patients thousands of miles away. Underpinning all this new connectivity will be a lot more software that can lead to more vulnerabilities.

 Its not just about letting smartphone users download a high-definition movie in seconds instead of minutes. This next generation of mobile infrastructure promises to usher in a new wave of innovation that can drive economic growth. Supporters say Huawei, the worlds biggest maker of networking equipment such as switches and antennas, can help countries meet that goal because it makes cheap, good-quality gear that appeals to wireless carriers. Banning Huawei puts Britain at risk of falling behind economically, they say. Complicating matters, some British wireless carriers have already started installing Huawei 5G gear and dont want to spend more money ripping it out.

 Cell networks have traditionally consisted of two parts. Theres the “radio access network” made up of antennas and base stations on rooftops and masts. Theres also the “core,” the brain keeping track of smartphones connecting to the network so account holders can be billed along with managing data traffic flowing across the entire network. With 5G, US officials worry that the core will run extensively on software. Millions of lines of computer code would present a huge “attack surface” and it could be nearly impossible to spot an accidental vulnerability or a malicious “backdoor” that can be used for siphoning information or crippling vital connected infrastructure like a power grid. These fears arent entirely unfounded. Huawei equipment has for years been inspected at a lab overseen by British officials, who said in their latest annual report that the companys software was buggy.

 Not many. Huawei mainly competes with two Scandinavian rivals, Finlands Nokia and Swedens Ericsson, for wireless infrastructure contracts. South Koreas Samsung and Cisco in the US are smaller competitors. A big reason the Huawei decision has become so fraught is that the global telecom equipment industry has been whittled down to just a handful of players. UK security officials have been hesitant to ban Huawei completely because they want to maintain a diverse range of suppliers to guard against risks. One less company means the security risks are concentrated in the remaining players.

 A similar debate has been playing out in Germany, Europes biggest economy, whose decision could influence smaller neighbours. And the European Unions executive Commission is set to release on Wednesday non-binding guidelines for 5G. Europe is Huaweis biggest market outside China and it has effectively been barred in the US.

1239,0,English,xyz,"Mudbound director Dee Rees is returning to the Sundance Film Festival with her next feature, The Last Thing He Wanted, a political thriller based on a 1996 Joan Didion novel. The story follows hardscrabble journalist Elena McMahon (Anne Hathaway) who finds herself on dangerous ground as the Iran Contra Affairs arms for drugs plot reaches its tipping point. The movie also stars Willem Dafoe as Hathaway’s father, Rosie Perez as her photojournalist friend, Ben Affleck as a government official, and Edi Gathegi.

 Anne Hathaway in a still from The Last Thing He Wanted trailer | Twitter

 While the movie is set in Reagan era, it also draws parallels with subjects pertaining to the Donald Trump administration such as immigration laws and government secrecy. When ponited out the similarities, Hathaway in an interview told Variety, The migrant crisis really made front-page news while we were filming. Then the next level of family separation started. This whole U.S. involvement was obscured while it was going on in the 1980s, people still aren’t talking about the fact that people we’re turning away to our country, part of the reason why they’re escaping their own countries is because of us. It felt really present. It felt like, “Oh, here we are making those same mistakes again.”

 Hathaway, who plays a staunch journalist in the film, says she didn’t really focus on the journalism part, but was more concentrated on playing Elena. However, filmmaker Rees did put her in touch with a few journalists, who helped her get the insider look. She adds that a very few actors get a map written for them by Joan Didion. And so between Joan’s point of view and Dee’s point of view, there wasn’t a whole lot for her to do except just ground down.

 This year, the lineup of 118 feature-length films at Sundance, includes 44 first-time filmmakers and is among the most diverse in the festival’s 37-year history. In the four competition categories, 46% of the directors are women, 38% are people of color and 12% are LGBTQ.

 When asked if Hollywood is also witnessing this fast change, Hathaway brushes away the subject and says I think the key is not to get lost in those in-between moments, not to panic. It’s happening. No, it’s not happening fast enough. Things are good. Things could get better. Let’s keep going. Let’s not panic and let’s keep talking about it.

 The Last Thing He Wanted will debut on Netflix on 21 February.

 “The GST collection in January is as per the revised target of Rs 1.15 lakh crore. It is achievable as we have been able to plug revenue leakages worth about Rs 40,000 crore by using technology and data analytics,” an official told the paper.

 The highest monthly GST collection so far, since its introduction in July 2017, was Rs 1.13 lakh crore in April 2019. Collections crossed the Rs 1 lakh crore mark in November and December 2019.

 Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

 The Department of Revenue has raised the GST collection target to Rs 1.15 lakh crore for January and February from the previous target of Rs 1 lakh crore, the report said. The target for March has been set at Rs 1.25 lakh crore.

 The direct tax collection is expected to be proportionately better than FY19, the article quotes another official as saying.

 The shortfall in gross direct tax collection for April-January of FY20 is pegged at Rs 11,000 crore, the report said, adding that for the first 10 months of FY20, gross direct tax collection is estimated at Rs 9.01 lakh crore as compared to Rs 9.12 lakh crore the previous year.

 The Centre has budgeted a 25 percent growth in net tax revenue at Rs 16.5 lakh crore for FY20.

 The company reported a 2.03 percent rise in its consolidated net profit to Rs 251 crore for the quarter against Rs 246 crore for the corresponding period previous fiscal, Torrent Pharmaceuticals said in a BSE filing.

 Consolidated revenue from operations stood at Rs 1,966 crore. It was Rs 2,051 crore for the year-ago period.

 Net sales declined by 1.2 percent to Rs 1,924 crore in the quarter from Rs 1,948 crore in December 2018.

 Torrent Pharmas revenue from the India business grew 5 percent YoY to Rs 871 crore. Brazil revenues went up 12 percent YoY to Rs 189 crore, while those of the US were down 22 percent to Rs 381 crore. Germany revenues stood at Rs 219 crore, down by 18 percent.

 The stock witnessed spurt in volume by more than 1.24 times and was quoting at Rs 1,928.20, down Rs 98.65, or 4.87 percent. It has touched an intraday high of Rs 2,022 and an intraday low of Rs 1,925.05.

 Credit Suisse set target at Rs 1,700 per share.

 The company reported a weak quarter in both India and Germany, with EBIT miss at 2 percent as cost was lower due to rationalisation of field force.

 The brokerage expects growth to pick up in the next quarter, aided by three new launches. Key for the stock will be whether the company can revert to 11-12 percent growth trajectory, it added.

 Research firm CLSA has also maintained outperform call on the stock and raised target to Rs 2,050 from Rs 1,950 per share.

 It is of the view that India is likely to remain the key growth driver. India growth was weak at 5 percent due to one-offs linked to stockists, while supply-chain issues with respect to the EU should be resolved by March, it said.

 US revenue was flat QoQ and will likely decline in FY21. The US FDA issues at its key manufacturing sites will take time to resolve. CLSA believes that India will be a key medium-term growth driver and raised FY20 EPS estimates by 3 percent.

1247,0,English,xyz,"We think infrastructure and consumer sectors are likely to hog the limelight in Budget 2020 due to the impact that the Budget can potentially have on companies in these sectors, Vinay Paharia, CIO Union Asset Management Company, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.

 Edited excerpt:

 What are your expectations from the upcoming Budget?

 We think that this time, the Finance Minister has very few arrows in her quiver. The government has already announced changes in Corporate Taxes.

 Changes in indirect taxes are out of the purview of Union Budget and are administered by the GST council. In her various press conferences post Budget 2019, the FM has announced infra projects, given clarity on taxation aspects, etc.

 Thus, what remains are potential changes in the personal taxation, tweaks if any in the direct taxes and changes to allocation to various government schemes.

 Hence, unless some big bang direct taxation related announcements are made, the upcoming Budget can at best be a sentiment booster.

 Do you think the govt. will be able to meet its fiscal deficit target?

 The fiscal math is getting tighter by the day for the government. The fall in the direct taxes due to cut in the corporate tax rate, miss in divestment targets and the miss in GST collections may make it very difficult for the government to adhere to the fiscal deficit targets. We expect a slippage in FY20 and FY21 fiscal deficit targets.

 Which are the sectors that are likely to hog the limelight in this Budget 2020 and why?

 We think infrastructure and consumer sectors are likely to hog the limelight in Budget 2020 due to the impact that the Budget can potentially have on companies in these sectors.

 What are the expectations from Budget 2020 from investors or market perspective?

 Our expectation is for the government to make announcements to boost consumer sentiment and provide an outlook on fiscal responsibility.

 Do you think infrastructure could turn out to be a strong beneficiary in the upcoming Budget?

 The government has reiterated its commitment to the infrastructure sector and we expect the same to be reinforced in the upcoming Budget. However, we shall be watchful of cuts in government expenditure in the sector due to weakness in revenue collections.

 The govt struggled to meet the divestment target in FY20. What are the estimates you are factoring in for the next fiscal?

 We think the government has to increase its divestment target, as asset sales are the only means to meet the fiscal responsibility targets in the medium term.

They will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them. Parvesh Verma added, Theres time today, Modi Ji and Amit Shah wont come to save you tomorrow.

 The BJP MP openly threatened Shaheen Bagh protesters as he addressed a rally in west Delhis Ranhoula village under Vikaspuri assembly on January 27. Verma said if the BJP is voted to power in Delhi, it will only take an hour to clear off protests in Shaheen Bagh.

 This election [Delhi poll] is not a small election but that for stability and unity of the country. If a government of the Bharatiya Janata Party is formed on the February 11, then after an hour no one will be seen in Shaheen Bagh, said West Delhi BJP MP Parvesh Verma.

 Verma added that within one month all existing mosques built on government land in his constituency will be demolished if the Bharatiya Janata Party comes to power in Delhi this year.

 On January 27, BJP leader and Union minister Anurag Thakur sparked a row after he egged on participants of an election rally to raise an incendiary slogan that traitors should be shot, as he lashed out at anti-CAA protestors.

 At the rally, the minister of state for finance, shouted desh ke gaddaron ko to which the crowd responded goli maro sa*** ko (shoot down the traitors).

 The controversial slogan has been raised by some junior BJP leaders of late, including Kapil Mishra, but this is the first time a party functionary of the level of a Union minister has participated in it. Thakur is also heard telling the crowd to raising the slogan in such a high voice that Giriraj Singh, a firebrand Hindutva leader and a Union minister, can hear it.

 The incident has triggered a row, drawing a sharp reaction from the following which the Delhis Chief Electoral Officer sought a report from the returning officer of Rithala constituency over Thakurs speech.

1254,0,Telugu,abc,"New Delhi: A day after Union Minister Anurag Singh Thakur invited Election Commissions attention with his controversial remarks on anti-Citizenship Act protesters, now another BJP leader has triggered a row with his shocking statement on those protesting against the new Act.

 In an interview to news agency ANI on Tuesday (January 28), BJP MP Parvesh Verma said, Lakhs of people gather there [Shaheen Bagh]. People of Delhi will have to think and make a decision. They will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them. Parvesh Verma added, Theres time today, Modi Ji and Amit Shah wont come to save you tomorrow.

 The BJP MP openly threatened Shaheen Bagh protesters as he addressed a rally in west Delhis Ranhoula village under Vikaspuri assembly on January 27. Verma said if the BJP is voted to power in Delhi, it will only take an hour to clear off protests in Shaheen Bagh.

 This election [Delhi poll] is not a small election but that for stability and unity of the country. If a government of the Bharatiya Janata Party is formed on the February 11, then after an hour no one will be seen in Shaheen Bagh, said West Delhi BJP MP Parvesh Verma.

 Live TV

 Verma added that within one month all existing mosques built on government land in his constituency will be demolished if the Bharatiya Janata Party comes to power in Delhi this year.

 On January 27, BJP leader and Union minister Anurag Thakur sparked a row after he egged on participants of an election rally to raise an incendiary slogan that traitors should be shot, as he lashed out at anti-CAA protestors.

 At the rally, the minister of state for finance, shouted desh ke gaddaron ko to which the crowd responded goli maro sa*** ko (shoot down the traitors).

 The controversial slogan has been raised by some junior BJP leaders of late, including Kapil Mishra, but this is the first time a party functionary of the level of a Union minister has participated in it. Thakur is also heard telling the crowd to raising the slogan in such a high voice that Giriraj Singh, a firebrand Hindutva leader and a Union minister, can hear it.

 The incident has triggered a row, drawing a sharp reaction from the following which the Delhis Chief Electoral Officer sought a report from the returning officer of Rithala constituency over Thakurs speech.

The two nations, India and Brazil, signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to promote the use of biofuels, at the backdrop of the Brazilian president, Mr. Jair Bolsonaro’s India visit on Republic Day. The MoU involves the exchange of information on the production and sustainable use of biofuels. It aims to strengthen investments by extending support in creating favorable policies and regulations in India for biofuels, bioelectricity, and biogas.

 This step will not only help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in India but also help redirect the sugar surplus in India, which currently requires government subsidies to guarantee competitive prices in the international market.

 India has the potential to become one of the largest Ethanol producers in the world due to its large-scale sugarcane production. The country has set an Ethanol blending target of 10 percent by 2022 and 20 percent by 2030. To help India make this transition, Brazil aims to facilitate an exchange of experiences, knowledge, innovations, and technologies that will enable India to increase the production of Ethanol fuel. Acceptance of Ethanol as an alternative fuel will reduce India’s dependence on crude oil imports, ensure energy security and generate local jobs and income.

 Commenting on the India and Brazil cooperation for the Ethanol Program, Mr. Eduardo Leão de Sousa, Executive Director of UNICA says “Government of India’s interest in pursuing biofuel production to support energy security is a considerable step in the right direction. With the strengthening of the Ethanol program, India is slated to have large economic and environmental benefits. India has been dealing with the challenges of pollution for the longest time. By introducing mandatory rules enabling the blend of Ethanol fuel in cars, the country will be able to reduce its CO2 emissions significantly. We hope that with Brazil’s 40 years of expertise in Ethanol, India will be in a position to achieve its bioenergy goals and create an ecosystem for a sustainable future”.

 Brazil and the United States account for 75 percent of bioethanol produced in the world. In 2018-19, Brazil produced 621 million tonnes of sugarcane, of which it produced 33 billion liters of Ethanol. The country blends 27% Ethanol in gasoline that provides a 20% reduction in GHG emissions per kilometer driven compared to pure petrol. UNICA aims to play a leading role in the consolidation of the Brazilian sugarcane industry as a modern agro-industrial complex equipped to participate in sustainability initiatives, in Brazil, India and globally, as suppliers of Ethanol, sugar, and bioelectricity.

 New Delhi, Jan 28: Harmeet Singh, a top Khalistan terrorist involved in the killing of several Hindu leaders in Punjab has been killed near Lahore.

 He was killed by a local gang over a financial dispute that stemmed out of a drug deal, sources tell OneIndia. The source said that he was shot by a local gang near the Dera Chahal Gurudwara near Lahore.

 Harmeet alias Happy PhD took over as the chief of the Khalistan Liberation Force in 2014 after the outfits boss Harminder Mintoo was arrested by the Punjab Police from Thailand. Mintoo had managed to escape from jail, but he was arrested again. He died of a cardiac arrest in 2018.

 Khalistan terrorists using online accounts of jail inmates to transfer money, fund terror

 Singh, who was killed was living in Pakistan for the past 20 years under the patronage of the ISI.

 In 2018, several Hindu leaders were killed. The police said that these were acts of terror carried out by the Khalistan groups. The National Investigation is seized off a probe involving the killing of several Hindu leaders in Punjab. The NIA probe revealed that the plan was hatched in Pakistan, while the funds came in from Canada, UK and Italy.

 In Punjab there have been such murders galore and the year 2017 has seen five such incidents. In 2016, there were two such incidents. The NIA probe into these incidents suggest that the mastermind is a person called Gursharanbir Singh who is a British national. He is the one who roped in Ramandeep and Hardeep Singh and directed them to kill Hindu leaders.

 The handlers who directed the killing of RSS and other Hindu leaders have been traced to Italy, Canada and the United Kingdom. The Punjab police which is probing the case learnt that there is a systematic approach that has been followed to eliminate Hindu leaders by ISI agents. The motive behind the killings is to destabilise the state, the police say.

 The ISI wants to cause communal tension in Punjab. Once the state becomes volatile then it could be used as a platform to launch the Khalistan forces, the police also said. The police got information about the modus operandi following three very high profile arrests.

 Recently the NIA took over the probe into the killing of two persons-Satpal Sharma and his son Ramesh Kumar at Ludhiana. An NIA officer explained to OneIndia that the during the investigation it was found that killings of Satpal Sharma, his son Ramesh Sharma and Durga Gupta were part of trans-national conspiracy hatched by senior leadership of the Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF).

 Eight incidents of such killings were executed as part of this conspiracy between January, 2016 and October, 2017 in Punjab. The objective of the conspiracy was to destabilize the law and order situation in Punjab and to revive the fledgling terrorism in the state.

 It was found that the conspiracy had its foot-prints in several countries including, Pakistan, UK, Australia, France, Italy and UAE. As part of the conspiracy, large amounts of funds were supplied through Italy, Australia and the UK to the perpetrators of the Killings/ Attempted Killings, viz. Hardeep Singh and Ramandeep Singh.

 K2 cocktail: Why Pakistan’s Kashmir-Khalistan operation should worry India

 These funds were used by them to purchase weapons for executing the killings and other logistics.

 The conspiracy included recruitment and training of Hardeep Singh and Ramandeep Singh in Italy, Dubai and UAE.

 Accused Hardeep Singh is a permanent resident of Italy while accused Ramandeep Singh belongs to Ludhiana. Both these persons were trained by one Gursharanbir Singh, a UK national. Another UK national, Jagtar Singh Johal, who has been arrested in the case was involved in the funding of the conspiracy. Day to day co-ordination of the conspiracy was done by Pakistan based Harmeet Singh @ PhD, the NIA had said.

 Mumbai, Jan 28: Flag carrier Air India has kept one of its 423-seater jumbo plane ready in Mumbai for the evacuation of Indian citizens from Wuhan province in China in the wake of Cornovirus outbreak in the East Asian country, an official source said on Tuesday.

 The airline is awaiting necessary approvals from the ministries of External Affairs and Health to operate the special evacuation flight, the source said. The decision follows the government instructions to various ministries to take steps to deal with the issue.

 We have kept a Boeing 747-400 ready in Mumbai to operate an evacuation flight to China whenever we get a go ahead from the government, the source said.

 Coronavirus cure: Tamil Nadu doctor from Rathna Siddha Hospital claims to have invented medicine

 Some 250 Indians are to be evacuated, the source said, adding, we are awaiting clearances from Ministry of External Affairs and also from Health Ministry. The Health Ministrys nod is required because the operating crew has to fly in a virus outbreak territory.

 At the Cabinet Secretary meeting on Monday, the government decided that steps may be taken to prepare for the possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan.

 Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus in China is a novel strain and not seen before. The outbreak has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome).

 Accordingly, Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities while the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Ministry of Health will make arrangements for transport and quarantine facilities respectively, an official release had said on Monday.

 Government also asked the Civil Aviation Ministry to issue instruction to airlines for managing and notifying anybody reporting illness on all direct and indirect flight to China besides facilitating in-flight announcements and distribution of health cards to all flights with direct or indirect connectivity to China. Officials said Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities for evacuation of Indian nationals, mostly students, stuck in Wuhan city.

 It was decided that steps may be taken to prepare for possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan. Accordingly, Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities, a government statement said.

 Wuhan along 12 other cities have been completely sealed by the Chinese authorities to stop the virus from spreading. The death toll climbed to 80 with 2,744 confirmed cases. Over 250 to 300 Indian students are reportedly stuck in Wuhan triggering concerns over their well-being.

1262,0,Gujarati,pqr,"The electric mobility industry in India can currently be said at best to be fledgling. Especially the electric passenger vehicle space. In FY2018-19, only 2,000 electric cars were sold in India. However, the movement in the sales chart during this year gives hope for the market. 200 units in Q1, 500 in Q2, and 800 in Q3. Shailesh Chandra, president – Electric Mobility Business & Corporate Strategy, Tata Motors, is bullish that the sales volume during Q4 will be much higher. The Nexon EV would be expected to play a good role in that growth.

 The Nexon SUV, a key player in Tata Motors turnaround drive in the passenger vehicle industry, has an additional role now of helping realise its makers ambition of being a proactive winner in the electrification space. It comes with a certified driving range of 312km (240-260km in real-world driving conditions). The 30.2 KwH Lithium-ion battery pack takes eight hours to get fully charged (from SOC 20%) in a regular 15 amp AC plug point. With a DC fast charger, the charging time is an hour (SOC 0% to 80%). Peak power output from the permanent magnet motor is 129PS and torque of 245 Nm.

 During an early morning drive in and outside Pune city, I got a good experience of the Nexon EV, which tries to pitch itself as an affordable performance electric vehicle (EV). At an expected entry price of Rs 15 lakh or thereabouts, the base variant of the Nexon EV will cost around 25 percent more than the Nexon diesel AMT thats currently available. Our research and survey shows that the consumers are ready to accept this car if it is within that price bracket because electric vehicles give you other advantages like lower running cost, low maintenance cost, says Chandra. If that is so, then the Nexon EV should be able to give a boost to the emerging segment of electric passenger vehicles. It joins the Hyundai Kona and MG ZS in the emerging electric SUV space, but sits much below them in terms of price segment.

 In terms of performance, the Nexon EV has a claimed 0-60kph acceleration figure of 4.6 seconds, and 9.9 seconds for 0-100kph. Good performance considering it weighs 120kg more than the IC-engined Nexon. While driving, a flick of the rotary switch to S mode added significantly to the vehicles drive performance. The Nexon EVs CG is lower by 40mm over the ICE Nexon and its weight is equally distributed between the front and rear. The battery pack of the Nexon EV has been smartly packed in the vehicles floor area, and protected by thick sheet metal steel with reinforced structures. The IP67 rating gave confidence to the Tata team to let us do a water-wading test where the water level stood at 300mm. The vehicles ground clearance is 205mm.

 The Nexon EVs battery pack gets the liquid-cooled treatment to maintain a temperature level of 25-35 degree Celsius. The battery management system gets a master unit and a slave unit to help the battery pack operate efficiently. Data from each and every cell at every moment is monitored so that the battery runs absolutely well, says Anand Kulkarni, vice-president, Passenger Electric Vehicles, Tata Motors. The Nexon EV’s battery has an IP67 rating, which means it can even sit on the bottom of a 1-metre-high pool for half an hour before letting in any moisture. It comes with an eight-year/ 1.6 lakh KMs warranty. With growing concern about environment impact due to disposed batteries, Tata Motors says its currently working on various aspects of battery disposal, or reuse and refurbishing of batteries.

 Three variants are being offered for the Nexon EV. The tyre size (215/60 R16) remains the same as the ICE Nexon. The engineering team had to resist the temptation of going for thinner tyres and extract few more kilometres of driving range. Tata Motors says that there are no tweaks made to the ICE Nexon that will be a compromise in its EV avatar, but some tweaks were required for the vehicle’s safety quotient. We ran a separate, parallel safety programme for the purpose of an EV, says Kulkarni.

 As the megatrends of electrification and connected vehicles grow, the Nexon EV tries to enhance its value proposition with a suite of connected features through a mobile application. It boasts of 35 connected features, key among which are geofencing (within an area or out of an area) the vehicle, remote operation of air-conditioning, ignition and find and reach that very important nearest charging station. The Nexon EV is also the first Tata vehicle to offer the ‘What 3 Words’ feature which facilitates users to reach any place in the world within a radius of 3 square metres based on a set of 3 unique words for every place.

 With its set of specifications, performance and features, the Nexon EV makes a good pitch. Whether customers in the 20-plus markets where it will initially be available in take to driving an emission-free vehicle, paying a healthy premium in terms of acquisition cost will depend upon how well Tata Motors’ marketing and sales channel educates people and the expansion of EV charging network. While that happens, electric mobility could also be heading towards better times, with some aid from the regulations/technology driven inflationary trend in the ICE vehicle industry.

Claiming that the organization had spent Rs.130 crore on the anti-CAA protests, he recalled how Pakistan had sponsored stone-pelting in Jammu and Kashmir. Moreover, he contended that Pakistan was desperate after the abrogation of Article 370 and therefore, engineering “violent protests” to destabilise the country. Thereafter, he called upon Indians to accept this reality.

 The NCP third of the Maha Vikas Aghadi seemingly has a difference of opinion over the issue of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). NCP leader and state Cabinet Minister Nawab Malik on Tuesday has declared that NRC will not be implemented in Maharashtra but if any proposal or resolution comes then all three parties will first discuss the proposal and then make a decision.

 Malik added that Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has said that they will not implement CAA and NRC, further opining that no single party would take a call on the issue of CAA and NRC.

 Interestingly, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar on Monday maintained that CM Uddhav Thackeray thinks there should not be any problem in Maharashtra concerning the CAA or the proposed NRC. The Deputy CM further opined that the states which passed an anti-CAA resolution are ruled by one party, calling it a reason for their aggressive stance against the Act.

 States like Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal have passed resolutions against the Citizenship Amendment Act. They are ruled by one party, unlike Maharashtra. Our Chief Minister (Uddhav Thackeray) said there should be no problem for anyone in the state due to CAA and NRC. We are of this opinion, Pawar said as quoted by ANI.

 Besides the issue of the CAA or the NRC, opposing views in Maha Vikas Aghadi have come to the fore over several other issues since the formation of the tri-partite government in the state was constituted. Ideologically opposite alliance partners Shiv Sena and the Congress have time and again given contrasting statements on conferring Bharat Ratna to freedom fighter Veer Savarkar. The Sena idolizes Savarkar while the Congress calls him a traitor. Sena has supported the decision of the central government conferring Padma Shri to singer Adnan Sami, which has been opposed by NCP and Congress.

In 2018 manifesto, the Congress, ahead of Rajasthan elections had stated that the party will work towards providing facilities including citizenship and rehabilitation to Pakistan displaced refugees who have been living in India.

 Air quality was “very poor” category in Anand Vihar and “poor” category in Punjabi Bagh, Lodhi Road and ITO, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

 The Air Quality Index (AQI) was at 338 in Anand Vihar, 341 in Rohini and at 339 in Mundka—all three in the “very poor” category according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) data.

 Air quality in Delhi had deteriorated on Monday to “very poor” on the CPCB scale. The CPCB’s AQI read 345 on Monday. It was mainly due to the reduction in wind speed from over 20kmph on January 23 to less than 10kmph, the minimum wind speed required in Delhi to disperse pollutants.

 The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had on Sunday predicted widespread rain and snowfall in the western Himalayan region, northern plains and states in the country’s east because of a fresh western disturbance (WD).

 The met department had said Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, parts of Rajasthan, north Madhya Pradesh and eastern India will receive rainfall, accompanied by lightning and hail, over the next three days.

 Isolated places in Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand will receive heavy rain and snow.

 This will be the seventh WD in January. A WD is a storm originating in the Mediterranean region that brings winter rain to the north-western parts of the Indian subcontinent. Usually, there are just three WDs in January.

 US President Donald Trump said on Monday he will announce his long-delayed Middle East peace proposal on Tuesday and that he believes Palestinians will eventually go along with it despite their refusal to engage on the subject.

 Sitting down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Trump said his plan “makes a lot of sense for everybody.” Of the Palestinians, Trump said, “It’s something they should want,” but he declined to say how it would be good for them.

 Trump will deliver joint remarks with Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday to outline his plan, which US officials intend to generate momentum toward resolving one of the world’s most intractable conflicts.

 Palestinians fear the plan will dash their hopes for an independent state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, areas Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.

 “They probably won’t want it initially,” Trump said. “But I think in the end they will… It’s very good for them. In fact it’s overly good to them. So we’ll see what happens. Now without them, we don’t do the deal and that’s okay.”

 Trump added, “We think there’s a very good chance that they’re going to want this.”

 After his session with Netanyahu, Trump met separately with Benny Gantz, the head of Israel’s centrist Blue and White Party, who is the right-wing prime minister’s rival in a March 2 election.

 Palestinian leaders say they were not invited to Washington for Trump’s presentation of his long secret peace blueprint and that no plan could work without them.

 “We reject it, and we demand the international community not be a partner to it because it contradicts the basics of international law and inalienable Palestinian rights,” Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said on Monday. “It is nothing but a plan to finish off the Palestinian cause.”

 Palestinians have refused to deal with the Trump administration in protest at its pro-Israeli policies such as moving the US Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, whose eastern half Palestinians seek for a future capital.

 DISTRACTION

 Trump’s two days of meetings with the Israelis stand in contrast to a trial in the Republican-led Senate weighing articles of impeachment submitted by the Democratic-led House of Representatives against the Republican president.

 But whether it truly will jumpstart the long-stalled effort to bring Israelis and Palestinians together is far from certain.

 Palestinians denounced a $50-billion economic revival plan the Trump administration set forth last July to lift the Palestinian and neighbouring Arab state economies because the proposal did nothing to address Israeli occupation.

 The White House hope was that support from both Netanyahu and Gantz would provide momentum.

 Having both Israeli leaders present removes the domestic Israeli political tensions, said a US source familiar with internal deliberations.

 “The rationale…is it depoliticizes this to the point that, no matter what happens on March 2, the two leaders of the two largest parties can potentially be supportive,” the source said.

 The Trump plan is the product of three years’ effort by senior advisers Jared Kushner and Avi Berkowitz, as well as Jason Greenblatt, who left the government last autumn.

 The proposal, more than 50 pages long, aims to take on some of the most difficult issues separating the two sides, such as the status of Jerusalem.

 PALESTINIAN THUMBS-DOWN

 But Palestinians called Trump’s proposal dead in the water even before its publication.

 Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said Washington can no longer be regarded as an honest mediator. In addition to the actions he to, Jan 27 (ok on Jerusalem, Trump slashed hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the Palestinians.

 Palestinian and Arab sources who were briefed on the draft fear it seeks to bribe Palestinians into accepting Israeli occupation, in what could be a prelude to Israel annexing about half of the West Bank including most of the Jordan Valley, the strategic and fertile easternmost strip of the territory.

 Further obstacles to a peace deal include the expansion of Israeli settlements on occupied land and the rise to power in Gaza of the Islamist movement Hamas, which is formally committed to Israel’s destruction.

 The Trump administration in November reversed decades of US policy when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced that Washington no longer regarded Israeli settlements on West Bank land as inconsistent with international law.

 Palestinians and most of the international community view the settlements as illegal. Israel disputes this.

 Netanyahu, a veteran right-wing leader, faces political and legal troubles at home as he heads for his third election in less than a year, and was indicted on criminal charges in November. He denies any wrongdoing.

 Netanyahu’s principal domestic political rival, Gantz, a centrist former general, last week lifted his objection to having the peace plan published before Israel’s March election. He had previously seen it as interference in the vote.

 Ricky Martin’s wide smile began to fade as the Puerto Rican superstar talked about his next album.

 It’s influenced by the U.S. territory’s political turmoil as people struggle to recover from Hurricane Maria and a recent 6.4 magnitude earthquake that killed one person and destroyed hundreds of homes amid a 13-year recession.

 “I’m going to use my music to carry the message of all those who aren’t being heard,” he told The Associated Press on Monday while preparing for a concert on his native island.

 The 48-year-old father of four children joined in the big demonstrations last year that led Ricardo Rosselló to resign as the island’s governor, and although he hasn’t been at the most recent protests against current Gov. Wanda Vázquez, he has gone on social media urging her to step down.

 “It would be an act of justice for our island,” he said in a video Thursday. “There are no immediate legal mechanisms for you and your entire team to leave and pay for all our suffering. But I have good news. The elections come in November and I am certain, certain, that the people will rise up more than ever.”

 Martin’s upcoming album is not the one he originally envisioned. He said he was going through a very romantic period in his life when he began recording, but all that changed when the 2019 protests in Puerto Rico erupted. The demonstrations were fed by anger over corruption and over the way the government responded to Hurricane Maria, the September 2017 storm that wreaked havoc on the island, killing an estimated 2,975 people in its aftermath.

 Martin participated in the demonstrations alongside other artists and found a new idea for the album.

 “When I returned to the studio, everything that I had done musically expired because I had poetic material in my head to share with the world after what happened in the streets of Puerto Rico,” he said.

 Martin said the album will be titled “Movimiento” and will contain 12 songs.

 “In all of them, I will in some way express everything that I experienced,” he said, alluding to the demonstrations. “All of the stories I heard from people who simply were not being heard.”

 One of the album’s songs is the newly released single “Tiburones,” which means “sharks” in Spanish. The video was shot in Puerto Rico and shows a woman face to face with police in riot gear. Around her neck is a green kerchief that Martin said was the actress’ idea to wear and one he fully supports since it symbolizes the fight for a woman’s right to have an abortion.

 “What I’ve always wanted is a woman to have the right to do whatever she wants with her body,” he said. “I’m always going to defend that.”

 Some have criticized Martin’s involvement in the 2019 protests and his recent comments regarding the current government’s response to the earthquake and strong aftershocks, accusing him of being an opportunist and of riling people up only to leave the island afterward. Others have posted online messages asking that he stay out of the island’s affairs.

 Martin remains unfazed.

 “I shouldn’t be interested in Puerto Rico because I don’t live in Puerto Rico?” he asked. “To the contrary. I believe that not being on the island has made me appreciate my culture more, appreciate my people more, my language, my music, where I come from.”

 The brother of rapper Nicki Minaj was sentenced Monday to 25 years to life in prison for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl at his Long Island home.

 A judge convicted Jelani Maraj of predatory sexual assault and child endangerment in November 2017. The victim testified during the trial that Maraj repeatedly raped her in 2015 while her mother was at work.

 Prosecutors have said DNA evidence recovered from the girl’s pajama pants was linked to Maraj. The girl’s younger brother also testified at the trial that he witnessed one assault.

 Maraj’s attorney appealed conviction in 2018, claiming that there was jury misconduct. The judge ruled in October that the defense did not meet the necessary burden of proof.

 Maraj said in court Monday that he had an alcohol problem and asked for a “second chance.” One of his attorneys said he suffered from health issues including hypertension, gout and anemia and requested the minimum sentence of 10 years to life.

 Maraj’s appellate attorney, Stephen Scaring, said he plans to appeal the judge’s decision.

 Brent crude was down 37 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $58.95 at around 0348 GMT, after touching a three-month low on Monday at $58.50, as the virus outbreak triggered a global sell-off in riskier assets.

 The US West Texas Intermediate was down 29 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $52.85, after slipping to its lowest since early October in the previous session at $52.13.

 The United States warned against travel to China and other countries put out advisories as the death toll from the spreading coronavirus outbreak rose to more than 100 people and left millions of Chinese stranded during the biggest holiday of the year.

 Oil investors have concerned travel advisories, other restrictions and any sizable impact on growth in the worlds second-biggest economy and elsewhere will dampen demand for crude and its products, amid plentiful supply.

 The near-term potential of a nationwide travel shutdown is high, said Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, a political and market risk consultancy.

 Barclays said oil prices could be $2 below its forecasts of Brent to be $62 a barrel over 2020 and $57 a barrel for WTI.

 The bank expects the grouping known as OPEC+ to take further steps to support the market when it meets in March if demand lags its forecast of between 600,000 and 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of 2020.

 While it remains to be seen how quickly the spread of the virus is contained, experience from the 2003 SARS outbreak suggests demand worries are likely overdone, the bank said.

 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), has been trying to play down the fallout from the virus, while Saudi Arabia, its de-facto leader, said on Monday the group could respond to any changes in demand.

 OPEC and producers including Russia, known as OPEC+, have been cutting supply to support oil prices for nearly three years and recently agreed to withhold a further 500,000 barrels bpd to 1.7 million bpd through March.

 Underlining the supply concerns, a Reuters poll forecasts US crude stockpiles to have risen last week.

Though cases of the virus have been confirmed in other countries, no fatalities have been reported outside China.

 The city of 11 million, where the virus emerged late last year, is now under effective lockdown. Footage shared on Chinas Twitter-like Weibo social media platform showed residents of apartment compounds in the city chanting Wuhan, you can do it! and singing the national anthem out of their windows.

 Canada, which has two confirmed cases of the virus and is investigating 19 more potential cases, warned its citizens to avoid travel to Hubei province.

 Authorities in Hubei, home to nearly 60 million people, are taking increasing flak from the public over their initial response to the virus, while much of the province is now under travel curbs.

 Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan on Monday to encourage medical workers and promise reinforcements. The most senior leader to visit the city since the outbreak, Li was shown on state TV leading medical workers in chants to boost morale.

 Full Confidence

 Chinas ambassador to the United Nations, following a meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday, said the Chinese government attaches paramount importance to prevention and control of the epidemic.

 China has been working with the international community in the spirit of openness, transparency and scientific coordination, he said.

 Guterres said the UN had full confidence in Chinas ability of controlling the outbreak, and stands ready to provide any support and assistance.

 Communist-ruled China has been eager to seem open and transparent in its handling of the epidemic, having been heavily criticised for its efforts to cover up an epidemic of the SARS coronavirus that killed about 800 people globally in 2002-2003.

 On Chinas heavily censored social media, officials have faced mounting anger over the virus, which is thought to have originated from a Wuhan market where wildlife was sold illegally.

 Some criticised the governor of Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, after he corrected himself twice during a news conference over the number of face masks being produced.

 If he can mess up the data multiple times, no wonder the disease has spread so severely, said one user of the Weibo social media platform.

 In rare public self-criticism, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang said the citys management of the crisis was not good enough and indicated he was willing to resign.

 Cases linked to people who travelled from Wuhan have been confirmed in a dozen countries, from Germany to the United States. Sri Lanka was among the latest to confirm a case.

 Markets Wobble

 Investors are worried that economic output will be hit in the short term as authorities limit travel and extend the week-long New Year holiday - when millions traditionally travel by rail, road and plane - by three days to limit spread of the virus.

 Asian stocks extended a global selloff on Tuesday. With Chinese markets shut investors were selling the offshore yuan and the Australian dollar as a proxy for risk.

 Oil was also under pressure as fears about the wider fallout from the virus mounted.

 The U.S. S&P 500 closed down nearly 1.6%.

 Echoing concern from South Korea on economic consequences, Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura warned that corporate profits and factory production might take a hit from the virus. China is Japans second-largest export destination and a huge market for its retailers, while Chinese make up 30% of all tourists visiting Japan.

 During the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally, air passenger demand in Asia plunged 45%. The travel industry is more reliant on Chinese travellers now, and Chinas share of the global economy has quadrupled.

 Some European tour operators cancelled trips to China, while governments around the world worked on repatriating nationals.

 Meanwhile Facebook asked employees to suspend non-essential travel to mainland China and told employees who had travelled to China to work from home.

1288,0,Gujarati,xyz,"The new strain of coronavirus spreading across China claimed its first victim in Beijing, officials said on Tuesday, as the death toll climbed to 106, the United States warned citizens against trips to the country and financial markets recoiled again at the potential impact on the worlds second-biggest economy.

 Amid mounting concern about the virus on Chinese social media, the National Health Commission said in a statement that all but six of those killed by the previously unknown flu-like virus were in Wuhan, Hubei province. Though cases of the virus have been confirmed in other countries, no fatalities have been reported outside China.

 The city of 11 million, where the virus emerged late last year, is now under effective lockdown. Footage shared on Chinas Twitter-like Weibo social media platform showed residents of apartment compounds in the city chanting Wuhan, you can do it! and singing the national anthem out of their windows.

 Tuesdays death toll was up from 81 as of the day before, while the number of total confirmed cases in China surged to 4,515 as of Jan. 27, from 2,835 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said.

 Global stocks fell, oil prices hit three-month lows, and Chinas yuan dipped to its weakest level in 2020 as investors worried about damage to the economy from travel bans over the Lunar New Year holiday period, which China extended in a bid to keep people at home.

 In case you are confused if this is a bizarre metaphor or perhaps, even a joke, it’s not. Microsoft’s Edge developers team took to Twitter to share images of the two cakes and thank Google’s Chromium developers team and FireFox for their “awesome cakes”. Take a peek:

 Notably, this cake giving tradition isn’t new. Microsoft started this tradition nearly 14 years ago in 2006 when Mozilla launched FireFox 2. According to a report by The Verge, since then the company has been sending cakes to Mozilla whenever it launched a new version of FireFox.

 Mozilla returned the favour in 2012 when Microsoft rolled out Internet Explorer 10. The tradition has been going on ever since.

 Microsoft’s cake giving tradition is a sweet gesture that shows that rivals can be friends. The gesture got the Tweeps, well, a bit sentimental.

Pune are now placed second in the points table with 10 points from two ties.The tie started with World No. 71 Kazumasa Sakai for Pune taking the court against Indias Ansal Yadav who was ranked many places below at 241 in the world ranking.

There was no stopping for the Japanese international as he soon leveled the score after the break and finally closed the game 15-14 coming back from behind.After the dramatic comeback in game one, it was Sakai who took the initiative and smashed his way past the defence of the left-handed Yadav.

Yew and Praneeth were fighting for each point but Yews deception and attack combination worked very well and he closed the first game 15-10 in style.The second game though was a different story and went in favour of Praneeth by 7-15. The third game was more evenly contested but after leading initially Yew couldnt keep the same level of game throughout and finally ended up losing the game and match 8-15 after a hard-fought three-game encounter. The tie stood level at 1-1.In womens singles, world No.2 Tai Tzu Ying took to the stage against young Rituparna Das of Pune 7Aces in a trump match for the Raptors. Living up to her reputation the Taiwanese No.1 didnt make many mistakes and closed the first game 15-3.Though, Das was not ready to back down as she came back strongly in the second game and went into the mid-game break leading 8-2.

1293,0,Hindi,abc,"As 626 of the 751 members of the EU Parliament moved six resolutions on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and Kashmir, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has written to the president of the European Union parliament over resolutions against the CAA saying that passing the same will set an “unhealthy precedent.”

 Arguing against the resolutions, Birla pressed to “respect sovereign processes of fellow legislatures”.

 The letter further read, “It is inappropriate for one legislature to pass judgement on another, a practice that can be misused by vested interests. I would urge you to consider the proposed Resolution in this light, confident that none of us want to set an unhealthy precedent.”

 Birla is perceived to be hinting at those opposed to the new citizenship law as “vested interests”. He wrote the letter to European Parliament President David Maria Sassoli.

 Amidst diplomatic backlash from the European Union (EU) parliament on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir, New Delhi has strongly reiterated that these matters are entirely internal to India.

 A total of six resolutions have been tabled by groups within the European Union (EU), including the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament (S&D), Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) (PPE), Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance (Verts/ALE), European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR), Renew Europe Group (Renew) and European United Left/Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) Group.

 The EU Parliament is set to debate on the resolutions tabled by a large chunk of its members, saying the enactment of the new law “marked a dangerous shift in India’s citizenship regime”.

 “The CAA marks a dangerous shift in the way citizenship will be determined in India and is set to create the largest statelessness crisis in the world and cause immense human suffering,” the resolution notes.

 The resolutions, set to be debated in the European Parliament in Brussels next Wednesday and voted the day after, come less than two months before Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to travel to Brussels for the India-EU summit on March 13.

 The CAA came into force in India last December amid massive protests in India.

 The new law, passed by Parliament last month, offers citizenship to non-Muslim persecuted religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. India has been witnessing massive protests against the new law with opposition parties, civil rights groups and activists saying granting citizenship based on religion is against the foundational principle of the Constitution.

 The Government has been emphasising that the new law does not deny any citizenship rights, but has been brought to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and give them citizenship.

 Interestingly, the resolutions come in the backdrop of EU diplomats not visiting Jammu and Kashmir along with 15 other foreign envoys earlier this month.

 Earlier it was reported that certain European envoys were not keen on a ‘guided tour’ of J-K and rather wanted to meet the people they wanted to interact with.

 However, the Indian government junked the reports as “unfounded and mischievous” and said that the envoys will undertake the trip at a later date.

 Earlier in October last, a delegation of Members of European Parliament (MEPs) had reached Jammu and Kashmir to assess the situation on the ground even as sporadic incidents of violence were reported from the Valley following the abrogation of Article 370.

 If you have watched high-altitude action movies like Vertical Limit, Cliffhanger, and Everest, you are probably aware the daredevil hiking scenes are performed by experts who train on difficult terrains for years.

 The edge-of-your-seat segments in these films are great for a theatre view. But it’s important to know that stunts are performed with state-of-the-art safety gear and emergency services on land and air.

 But recently, a hiker at Californias Rubio Canyon experienced a film-style moment while hanging from a cliff. The only difference was the experience was without any safety harness.

 The 69-year-old woman was hiking with a man when she somehow ended up away from the trail.

 When paramedics and rescuers arrived at the location on a helicopter, they saw the woman clinging onto some roots that were protruding from the side of the cliff. Without wasting any time, the helicopter lowered an emergency service worker via a rescue harness. Luckily, the rescuer got into position moments before the woman lost her grip on the roots and managed to lift her up to safety.

 The entire incident was caught on camera and later shared on social media. It has now gone viral on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

 Check it out:

 After the dramatic rescue, the woman was reunited with her partner at the top of the cliff. She suffered minor injuries but refused medical care. Later, she and her partner continued their hike.

 The Altadena Sheriffs Station in a statement said the couple made it up to the trailhead without any further assistance.

1299,0,English,pqr,"4 times Akshay Kumar averted box-office clashes

 A big announcement came from the Hindi filmdom on Monday morning as Akshay Kumar shared the new release date of his upcoming film, Bachchan Pandey. The masala action flick, earlier set to clash with Aamir Khan’s Laal Singh Chaddha on Christmas 2020, will now release on January 22 next year. Akshay’s decision came following a special request by Aamir. The Thugs of Hindostan actor has thanked Khiladi Kumar for what he called a “warm gesture.”

 This is not the first time when Akshay has obliged an industry colleague by shifting the release date of his film. In the last couple of years, he has done the same favour at least on three more occasions...

 Akshay Kumar had booked Eid 2020 for the release of his action flick, Sooryavanshi, much in advance. However, when Salman, who has been an Eid regular, announced InshaAllah for release on the same day, a major box-office clash was on the cards. But a couple of days later, Akshay happily agreed to move his film to March 27, 2020, giving InshaAllah a solo release.

 But a twist in the tale came when InshaAllah was shelved and Akshay decided to use the vacant slot for another one of his films, Laxmmi Bomb. The story saw another twist when Salman announced Radhe: Your Most Wanted Bhai for Eid 2020. Now, the clash between Akshay and Salman is very much on!

 Akshay Kumar’s female hygeine drama, Pad Man, was initially meant to be a solo release on Republic Day 2018. But its ‘solo release’ status was taken away when the makers of the controversy-ridden Padmaavat shifted the release date of the film from December 1, 2017 to January 25, 2018. Later, however, Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the director of Padmaavat, realised that Pad Man had all the potential to eat into the business of his high-budget period drama, which had umpteen controversies surrounding it. Therefore, he personally requested Akshay to move Pad Man to another date. The actor happily obliged and announced the new release date of Pad Man: February 9, 2018.

 Not many remember this but Akshay Kumar’s Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! and Shah Rukh Khan’s Chennai Express were set for a box-office clash on the big Eid holiday of August 8, 2013. But the clash was averted reportedly after a high-level meeting between the two parties, which resulted in Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara! getting postponed to August 15, 2013. It is not clear whether or not Akshay had a say in the matter but his film certainly let go off the benefit of the lucrative Eid slot.

 The Big Bash League 2019-20 saw one of the most incredible crowd catches on Monday. James Pattinson, who was padded up waiting to walk in next, took a fantastic catch when teammate Matthew Renshaw deposited a ball into the stands. The brilliance of the catch was as such that James Pattinson managed to hold on to the ball, despite wearing his batting gloves.

 Melbourne Renegades took on the Brisbane Heat in the final match of the Big Bash League on Monday and there it was a humdinger of sorts. The Heat opted to bat only to falter early on, with heavyweights Ben Cutting, Chris Lynn and AB de Villiers departing for paltry scores. Matthew Renshaw restored some lost pride as he breezed away to a half-century, helping Brisbane Heat post a score of 154 on the board. The instance occurred in the 17th over of the innings when Renshaw smashed a Cameron Boyce delivery over deep midwicket towards the Brisbane Heat dugout, only for James Pattinson to complete an outstanding crowd catch with his batting gloves on. Here’s the video:

 Despite James Pattinson’s heroic non-consequential catch, Brisbane Heat failed to defend their 154, as Australian skipper Aaron Finch scored an unbeaten half-century to guide the Renegades home. Finch joined hands with Afghanistan all-rounder Mohammad Nabi and the duo put on an undefeated 87-run stand to win the game with seven wickets in hand. James Pattinson was far from impressive with the ball, going wicketless in his 4 overs conceding 30 runs.

1304,0,English,abc,"There are some hair myths that we have been following from quite a while now. Read below to find out some hair myths that are completely untrue and that you should stop following right away.

 Haircare is something that should be followed by everyone. Be it using the right hair products or washing your hair at least twice a week, some things shouldnt be ignored when it comes to your hair. However, there are also something that you should ignore when it comes to your hair. With time, there are so many things that people have told us about our hair, that we are confused as to which one should be followed and which one should not. For example, almost everyone believes that frequent trims can help you with growth, but thats not quite true. There are many such myths that we have been hearing about all this while.

 Myth 1:

 Frequents trims helps you with hair growth: This is not true, since the ends of your hair dont affect the follicles in your scalp. As per research, hair grows an average of a quarter-inch every month- whether or not you trim it. Yes, getting rid of split ends can reduce hair fall and hair damage, but it wont add anything to the hair growth.

 Myth 2:

 If you use the same shampoo, it will stop working eventually: Again, you dont need to change shampoos to achieve healthy hair. However, if you have coloured your hair recently, then itll be ideal to switch to a more moisturising shampoo. Otherwise, stick with your favourite as long as you love it.

 Myth 3:

 Cold-water adds shine to your hair: Some things have been said to us from ages, and this is one such thing. And one such thing this washing hair with cold water will make it shinier. You need to know that your hair contains no living cells, it doesnt react to cold (or hot) water. Use conditioners and styling products that contain silicones and oils to smooth the cuticle. And limit damage to your hair from straightening treatments, hot tools and frequent dyeing.

 Myth 4:

 To maintain the health of your hair, brush it frequently: All of us have heard that rigorous brushing will stimulate blood flow to your scalp and boost hair growth. Well, sorry to break the bubble, but it aint true. Brushing causes friction on hair, leading to cuticle damage and breakage, which makes hair lusterless and frizzy.

 Myth 5:

 If you shampoo less, your scalp will produce less oil: The truth is shampooing and production of oil are not related to each other. So no matter how frequently you shampoo your hair, your scalp produces the same amount of oil. Genetics and hormones determine the amount of oil they produce. So, wash your hair with a moisturising shampoo when you feel you need it, whether thats daily or weekly.

 Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has been in the headlines last year for its second lunar explorer - the Chandrayaan 2. While the mission has not been a complete success, it had been one of the most highlighted space missions of the year 2019 all over the world.

 The organization recently also unveiled its plan for the first space man-mission called the Gaganyaan. ISRO itself has released some details on its next project and has also revealed that it will be roping in international agencies to complete the mission successfully.

 Indias Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, took the Republic Day 2020 center stage to comment on the first manned-mission by ISRO. Following are the details:

 According to Modi, ISROs Gaganyaan mission is going to be a historic achievement for India when it comes to the science and technology department. He further believes that this will be a milestone in the 21st century which India will achieve.

 He quoted, Gaganyaan mission will be a historic achievement in the field of science and technology for India in the 21st century. It will prove to be a milestone for New India.

 Modi also said, On the solemn occasion of Republic Day, it gives me great joy to tell you about Gaganyaan. The country has taken another step towards this goal. In 2022, we will be celebrating 75 years of Independence. And on that occasion, we have to fulfill the pledge to take an Indian into space through the Gaganyaan mission.

 This indicates that the Gagayaans launch will coincide with Indias 75 Independence day in the year 2022.

 ISROs first manned mission to space has been tipped to take off in 2021. While there is no specific date revealed, its launch in 2021 had been confirmed earlier by Jitendra Singh, Union Minister at one of the Parliamentary sessions.

 Just a few days ago, it was reported that ISRO will be taking help from CNES which is a French National Center for Space Studies organization to complete the mission successfully. Now, Modi has revealed that this mission will help the country to develop a strong relationship with Russia as well.

 He said, I am confident this will be another golden chapter of friendship and cooperation between India and Russia. They will be trained for over a year. After that, the responsibility of carrying the hopes and aspirations of the nation and soaring into space will rest on the shoulders of one of them. On the auspicious occasion of Republic Day, I congratulate these four youngsters and the Indian and Russian scientists and engineers associated with this mission, he said.

 The Indian government has already sanctioned a huge sum (Rs. 10,000 crores) for the Gaganyaan project. Thats not it, four Astronauts from India are said to be receive training from Novespace which is a CNES subsidiary on a modified Airbus A310 (parabolic flights with Air Zero Gravity). This modified spacecraft is said to replicate a zero-gravity environment of the Earth.

 The Indian government rolled out the FASTags and made it mandatory for every vehicle running on the national highway. FASTag helps at tolling plazas as drivers dont need to wait in a queue to pay cash, but instead, the FASTag collects the money directly from the bank. Now, Google Pay has added a feature to recharge FASTag.

 The new Google Pay update comes with a couple of new features, including the FASTag recharge. Google Pay users will be able to recharge their FASTag accounts using UPI. Users can simply link their FASTag accounts to the Google Pay app, which makes it convenient to recharge and also track the payments.

 Firstly, users looking to recharge their FASTag account via Google Pay will need to link the account. The account can be liked via Google Pay app > Bill Payments > FASTag. The Bill Payments option can be accessed by clicking on the New or the Rupee icon. On selecting the FASTag option, users can select the bank that has issued the FASTag.

 Google notes that if users dont spot the FASTag option immediately under suggested businesses, they need to click on more. If FASTag is again not listed, tap more again. Once through, the next screen will request the users to enter their vehicle number and proceed to pay with the bank account.

 Users can also check their FASTag account balance for FASTags issued by supported banks with the tap of a button, Google said. At present, Google Pay is offering two options, namely ICICI FASTag Recharge and IDFC First FASTag Recharge. Google Pay may add support for more banks issuing FASTag to its service.

 At the same time, the National Highways Authority of India has introduced a new way to check the FASTag account balance before users begin their journey. Users can avail the missed call alert facility to know their NHAI prepaid wallet balance. FASTag users can give a missed call to +91-8884333331 to get alerts about their NHAI wallet and accordingly recharge before heading out.

However, the spinner is finding it tough to adjust to the challenges possessed by the red-ball game.Playing Test cricket was always the dream and Im so honoured to have represented my country and province in the longest form of the game.

While bowling, the spinner took 334 wickets for Canterbury.He is also the highest wicket-taker for Canterbury in first-class cricket.Im really proud of what Ive been able to achieve with Canterbury and the Blackcaps.

 New Delhi: Billionaire investor Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has been summoned by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) in a case of alleged insider trading in shares of the training company. The market regulator is also reportedly probing the role of other family members, as well as some board members, including investor Ramesh S Damani and director Madhu Jayakumar.

 A source familiar with the matter was quoted in a Livemint report saying, “The regulator is examining a time frame of February 2016 to September 2016 for irregular trades, which it suspects were done on the basis of insider information.

 For those who may not be aware, insider trading is the illegal practice of trading on the stock exchange to ones own advantage through having access to confidential information. As per Sebi’s insider trading norms, communication of unpublished price-sensitive information is also considered a violation.

 Jhunjhunwala- also known as the Big Bull- is Indias 48th richest individual, according to Forbes. As of Tuesday (January 28, 2020), his net worth stands at $2.6 billion. He is often referred to as Indias Warren Buffett.

 It may be noted that son of an income tax officer, Jhunjhunwala started dabbling in stocks while still in college. He began investing with $100 in 1985 when the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) Index was at 150; it now trades over 41,000. Jhunjhunwalas most valuable holding is watch and jewellery maker Titan, worth $1.1 billion.

 It is to be mentioned that Rakesh Jhunjhunwalas portfolio component Ion Exchange on Monday hit its all-time high after the company reported a 237% rise in Q3 net profit.

1311,0,English,xyz,"A motivated Conor McGregor can beat anyone claims his striking coach Owen Roddy.

 Conor McGregor made his successful octagon return after a long fifteen-month layoff last Sunday when he faced Donald Cerrone. The fight took place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and McGregor knocked out Cerrone in just 40-seconds.

 Now that McGregor has made his successful return, fans are wondering as to what could be next for the Irishmen. The fight with Cerrone took place in the welterweight division and McGregor said that he was enjoying fighting at 170lbs.

 However, Owen Roddy said that Conor McGregor has been training ferociously and is motivated to the point where he can beat anybody. That is to say, Roddy wants to see Conor continue fighting at welterweight.

 “I don’t really mind who it is,” Roddy said on Ariel Helwani’s MMA Show. “I think Conor going in motivated, enjoying the training, the way he is can beat any of them, I really believe that.”

 “People were questioning can he carry that weight and that power up into that 170 weight class. But I’ve never seen him so ferocious in there,” Roddy said. “The shots he was throwing when Cerrone hit the ground were ferocious. You know what, not many people on this Earth can take those shots. I think he’s got lots of options. It’s always Conor’s choice. Whoever motivates Conor the most is the fight he will take place.”

 Roddy also gave a list of potential opponents for McGregor and he said that he wouldn’t mind seeing him fight Masvidal, Diaz and Justin Gaethje.

 “I wouldn’t mind him at 170lbs like Masvidal has been huge on people’s mind for months and there’s Diaz [Trilogy] again, which could be a big one and then I do like the idea of Gaethje as well.

 “I know Conor mentioned that he would be ready to go of Ferguson or Khabib dropped out as well,” Roddy concluded. (H/T – BJPENN)

 In lead-up to Cerrone vs McGregor, Dana White has repeatedly said that if Conor McGregor wins next, he will be fighting the winner of Khabib vs Tony even if Gaethje has been tearing through the lightweight division.

 “There’s been all this, ‘What about Justin Gaethje’ stuff. The reality is, me and Justin Gaethje need to sit down and talk face to face and have a meeting,” White said. “So, we’ll probably do that in the next few weeks and sit down with him. I like Gaethje. Gaethje’s a great kid, and he’s a super talented guy, and he and I need to get on the same page.”

 Justin Gaethje has been eagerly waiting for a title shot. He is currently on a three-fight winning streak and all his victories have come via first-round knockouts.

 Who do you guys want to see Conor McGregor fight next?

 Fuel prices in India were lowered for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday as international oil rates continued to slide over fears of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

 Petrol prices per litre were cut by 11 paise to Rs 73.60 in New Delhi, Rs 76.22 in Kolkata, Rs 79.21 in Mumbai and Rs 76.44 in Chennai. Diesel prices per litre were reduced by 13 paise to Rs 66.58 in New Delhi, Rs 68.94 in Kolkata, Rs 69.79 in Mumbai and Rs 70.33 in Chennai.

 International oil benchmark Brent crude was down by 0.3 percent to $59.17 per barrel on Tuesday. On Monday, the index had slipped to its lowest in three months to $58.50.

 Fuel prices in India are based on international oil price movements and rupees exchange rate.

 Chinese health authorities said that the coronavirus outbreak has killed 106 people and infected 4,515 raising fears across the globe. Countries, including the US, have issued warnings against travel to China, leaving millions of travellers stranded at the biggest holiday in the Chinese calendar.

 Investors in oil are concerned that travel restrictions and fall in economic growth will dampen demand for crude and its products while supply remains high.

 There are concerns that spread of infection, transportation disruptions, cancellation of group tours from China and an extension in the Lunar Holiday will likely hurt the global economy. If the situation takes longer to subside, it will hurt exports, output and corporate profits of companies that are impacted by production and consumption in China.

1314,0,Hindi,xyz,"Business

 Even as the markets continue to remain just 2 per cent below their historic lows, there are many good quality stocks that have dived to 52-week lows. Here are a few of them:

 ONGC

 Indias largest oil and gas exploration company is trading at Rs 116.80, which is just 1 per cent away from its 52-week low of Rs 115.55.

 A fall in crude prices has pushed the stock lower. Moreover, divestment of stake sale in the company may also be an overhang on the stock. However, at these levels the stock is trading at a 1-year forward p/e of just 5 times, which is almost half of the valuations when compared to global peers.

 At the current price of Rs 116.40, the stock yields a dividend of more than 6 per cent, which is not bad at all.

 Oil India

 Oil India is another oil and gas exploration company like ONGC, which is just 1 per cent lower than its 52-week low price of Rs 137.

 Again, the stock at the current market price of Rs 138.70, gives a good dividend yield of 7.30 per cent. If both these companies increase their dividends, the dividend yield is significanly higher.

 Hindustan Zinc

 Indias largest Zinc and silver producer has seen its share price drop to Rs 200, which is just three per cent away from a 52-week low. There were hopes that the board would declare dividends at the last board meeting when quarterly numbers were declared.

 However, that did not happen. The stock would remain a good bet for its dividend yields.

 Indian oil Corporation

 This is another stock that is just 3 per cent away from its 52-week low and is currently trading at Rs 117.40. Government owned oil marketing company stocks and those from the oil exploration business have both seen their share prices drop.

 One reason for the same could be the divestment. However, most of these stocks do offer value.

 Marico

 FMCG major Marico, is a stock that is just 4 per cent away from its 52-week lows. The stock is trading at Rs 339, against its 52-week low of Rs 324. FMCG stocks have been hurt on account of the economic slowdown. Some of these stocks could be a good bets for the long-term. If some of the PSU stocks declare good dividends, they would be ideal, given that dividends are tax free in the hands of investors up to a sum of Rs 10 lakhs.

 In the upcoming Union Budget 2020-21 which is due to be presented on February 1, 2020, there is just limited room for income tax rate cut.

 Officials Say There Is Limited Room For Income Tax Cut In Budget 2020

 As per a government official, the government will look at mopping at non-tax revenues in the financial year 2021 and also divestment and asset monetization will be pushed. Further in the year FY21, the governments stake in many of the PSUs will be pared down substantially.

 To encourage capital formation, there will be measures proposed to ease rules concerning DDT and LTCG tax.

 Experts hold the view that a cut in income tax and a higher exemption will leave more money in the hands of the lower and middle class people that will likely spur demand and consumption.

 Nonetheless, few are of the opinion that the step will likely be fruitful to a small degree only and the best option will be for the government to use money with it and fuel investment and hence propel demand.

 Bukayo Saka opened the scoring inside five minutes to cap a fine team move involving all 10 outfield players, with Eddie Nketiah doubling the visitors lead before the break.

 Mikel Artetas side conceded a late goal to Sam Surridge after he came off the bench for the Cherries, whose focus will switch back to the task of Premier League survival.

 Arsenal made an early statement of intent with an excellent display of passing and movement that led to Saka thrashing home the opener from the corner of the six-yard box, Joe Willock and Gabriel Martinelli proving particularly influential in the build-up.

 The industrious Willock was in the thick of the action again midway through the half, eluding Dan Gosling before calling goalkeeper Mark Travers into action.

 Bournemouth, who ended a six-match winless run in the league with a 3-1 win over Brighton and Hove Albion last time out, looked bereft of ideas and spent much of the first half on the defensive, with Harry Wilsons strike providing the only meaningful work for Emiliano Martinez.

 Arsenal lost Shkodran Mustafi to a serious-looking injury just past the hour mark and suffered a brief scare when Martinez flapped at a corner, the ball spinning wide off the head of the seemingly oblivious Jack Simpson.

 Artetas side appeared to be cruising until Surridge halved the deficit in stoppage time from fellow substitute Simon Francis probing ball, but it was too little too late and the Spaniard will be hopeful of adding to the two FA Cups he won as a player with the Gunners.

 What does it mean? Arteta eyes seasons silver lining

 While a top-four finish in the Premier League may not be beyond Arsenals reach, it is a significant stretch for a side whose top-flight win tally of six matches Bournemouths exploits this season. That leaves the FA Cup as a sizeable consolation prize for a club with a proud history in this competition.

 Lively Saka catches the eye

 Sakas impact on the game is evident from his goal and assist, but the 18-year-olds all-round display was just as noteworthy, with an 87.5 per cent passing accuracy, five recoveries and two chances created.

 Howe bad was that?

 Cherries boss Howe made six changes from the victory against Brighton and, with top-flight safety his primary objective, you can understand why. But the side he put out looked lost, producing a disjointed and tactically inept display that saw the tie put beyond their reach before the half-hour mark, with Surridges late strike failing to paper over the cracks.

 Whats next?

 Arsenal head to Turf Moor on Sunday (February 2) to take on a Burnley side who sit level with them on 30 points, while Bournemouth welcome Aston Villa for a crunch six-pointer on Saturday (February 1).

 James Rodriguez is wanted by both Arsenal and Everton.

 Bengaluru, January 28: Arsenal are reportedly set to compete with Everton for a loan deal of James Rodriguez.

 Real Madrid are reportedly keen to offload the 28-year-old Colombian attacking midfielder and are open to either a loan deal or a permanent one.

 It is presumed that the Los Blancos are willing to accept a fee around £34m for the player, but both Arsenal and Everton are more interested in a loan deal.

 Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti shares an excellent relationship with the Colombian whom he managed both at Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. In fact, he was the one who signed him at both clubs and was also close to reuniting with the 28-year-old at Napoli last summer.

 Arsenal, now managed by Mikel Arteta, are desperately short of quality and depth in almost every department. Mesut Ozil has managed to get back into the starting XI since the appointment of Arteta, but the Gunners could still do with more creativity in their side. And, Rodriguez is someone who could provide them exactly that. Things have not worked well for the Colombian in the last few years at Real Madrid and Bayern but his quality remains undisputed.

 Under Arteta, Arsenal have improved in terms of creating chances by leaps and bounds but have been let down by their shambolic defence. For the kind of free-flowing football Arteta is planning to play with the Gunners, a fit and confident Rodriguez could prove to be a welcome addition.

 US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has obtained $12 billion in financing commitments from more than a dozen banks to help alleviate the crisis over its 737 MAX jet, the design of which was implicated in two deadly accidents that led to the aircrafts global grounding.Initially, corporate liquidity was not a concern for the company, but the fact that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has extended the grounding forced Boeing to step up its search for loans to cover the debt it has accumulated after the two crashes in Ethiopia and Indonesia in which a total of 346 people died, reports Efe news.According to a CNBC report on Monday, analysts have said that obtaining such a large amount of funding, $2 billion more than expected, was a vote of confidence on the part of Wall Street investors.They also estimated that the firm has been losing about $1 billion a month because of the grounding after the pair of crashes.In the third quarter, Boeing reported almost $3 billion in negative free cash flow.The financing comes in the form ofDelayed Draw Term Loans, which the firm can access partially and as needed, with the prior agreement of the parties. These loans are generally provided only to borrowers with top credit ratings.In recent months, Boeing has experienced assorted scandals linked to the 737 MAX that have undermined the companys credibility and raised new questions about the safety of the aircraft.Several weeks ago, internal Boeing communications were published within the framework of the investigation being undertaken by the US Congress that revealed a lack of confidence among technicians and employees about the safety of the 737 MAX.In addition, an audit by the FAA earlier this month revealed new potential problems associated with the wiring that helps control the jets tail and the possibility that these problems could cause a short circuit if the wires were too close together.Recently, Boeing also made a recommendation to pilots that would be flying the 737 MAX that they train first on simulators, a measure that they have resisted in the past.On Wednesday, before the New York Stock Market opens, Boeing will announce its annual and fourth-quarter earnings and other figures, as well as a general outline of its financial strategy.

 Arsenal lost Shkodran Mustafi to injury in the 2-1 FA Cup win over Bournemouth, during which several young players impressed Mikel Arteta.

 London, January 28: Mikel Arteta was proud of his young Gunners after Arsenal secured an FA Cup fifth-round spot with a win over Bournemouth.

 The visitors, 13-time winners of the competition, secured a 2-1 triumph at the Vitality Stadium with Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah on target before substitute Sam Surridge grabbed a late consolation in an otherwise one-sided tie.

 Arsenals two goalscorers were the standout performers in a youthful line-up on a night when Artetas defensive options were further depleted by a serious-looking injury for Shkodran Mustafi.

 Bournemouth 1-2 Arsenal: Gunners set up Portsmouth 5th round FA Cup clash

 Arteta, while pleased with Mondays display, admitted the club would need to dip into the transfer market to bolster his squad, with a fifth-round trip to Portsmouth added to their schedule.

 Very pleased. Its always tough to come here and win, weve done it with a young team as well, the Gunners boss told BBC Sport.

 I have a lot of faith in them. I think they are developing really well. They are willing and hungry and will only get better.

 We analyse opponents and try to generate situations that are favourable for our players.

 I was worried with their history in the last few weeks we would concede in the last few minutes.

 Our history with this cup is massive for the club. We need to take it step by step.

 On the injury to Mustafi and his hopes to bring in reinforcements, Arteta added: We will have to assess him but when Mustafi has to come off, normally it is not good.

 We are in the market. We are looking for some things with the resources we have and we will tell you when we have more news.

 Opposite number Eddie Howe conceded his side lost the tactical battle and did not work hard enough without the ball to match their visitors.

 There were tactical problems for us, said the Cherries manager. We changed system a couple of times but we werent ourselves out of possession.

 We were second in the battles. Against quality teams that is what you have to master.

1327,0,English,pqr,"Lakers legend Bryant, 41, and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday, along with seven others in Calabasas, California.

 Sunday and Mondays games have gone ahead as tributes continue to pour in for the five-time champion and 2008 MVP, who spent his entire 20-year career with the Lakers.

 However, Tuesdays blockbuster clash at Staples Center will be rescheduled at a later date, with Los Angeles reeling following Bryants sudden death.

 The following has been released by the NBA pic.twitter.com/NgrEP2qpDi

 The decision was made out of respect for the Lakers organisation, which is deeply grieving the tragic loss of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other people in a helicopter crash on Sunday, the NBA said in a statement.

 Bryant, who entered the league with the Lakers in 1996, is regarded as one of the all-time greats following a career spanning two decades at Staples Center.

 An 18-time All-Star and two-time Finals MVP, Bryant won a pair of Olympic gold medals, helping United States to glory in 2008 and 2012.

 LeBron James and the Lakers (36-10) top the Western Conference, ahead of the Utah Jazz and Kawhi Leonards third-placed Clippers (33-14).

1328,0,Gujarati,xyz,"Hyundai’s latest compact sedan sure does look promising, but does it have the right ingredients to be the next success story? We find out.

 The compact sedan segment is no longer compact, with over nine cars already present in the ring. And now entering the royal rumble, we have the Hyundai Aura. Rivaling the Maruti Dzire, which accounts for more than 50 percent of the sales in this segment, there’s no doubt that it’s going to be a tough battle for the Hyundai Aura to carve some space for its own. What works in the favor of the Aura is that buyers have a wide range of powertrains to choose from all of which are BS6-compliant. There’s an 83hp, 1.2-litre petrol engine from the Nios that also does duty in the Aura, and you also have a 69hp, CNG variant of the same. The diesel engine is also the same as the Nios, but it is in a BS6 avatar for the first time in the Aura. In addition to this, there’s a 100hp, 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine that you will also find in the Venue compact SUV, but in a higher state of tune (120hp).

 Just like most Hyundai cars we have seen recently, the Aura is loaded with features. And with the Xcent slowly moving into the fleet market, the Aura might just be the car to revive Hyundai’s presence in the segment. So, without further delay, let’s find out what kind of aura does this car have.

 The Aura’s face is similar to the Grand i10 Nios on which it is based, but there are a few design elements that differentiate the sedan from the hatchback. For starters, the oversized ‘cascading grille’ from the Nios is smaller on the Aura and gets a satin grey surround trim. In the turbo-petrol variant, you get a black surround, which looks much better. The wide grille now also houses double boomerang LED DRLs at the top. Sweptback halogen projector headlamps and the bonnet with aggressive creases have been carried over from the Nios, and they work well here too.

 Talking about dimensions, while the length of all the cars in this segment is just shy of four metres, the Aura is narrower than the Maruti Suzuki Dzire, Honda Amaze and even the Ford Aspire. In profile, you can see how Hyundai has smartly stretched the Nios’ length without making it feel like just a slap-on boot modification. The 2,450mm long wheelbase is 25mm longer than the Xcent’s, which translates into marginally more cabin space. The roofline merges into the boot nicely and ends in a neat little ducktail spoiler. The rear is where the Aura’s design might polarise opinions. While the LED tail-lights look good, they do seem oversized and don’t go well with the overall design language.

 The Aura’s cabin is heavily based on the Nios’ cabin with minor changes. The only differentiator from the Nios is the dashboard trim above the glovebox, which comes in a satin bronze finish. The turbo-petrol variant gets an all-black interior theme with red inserts. The seats finished in black with red stitching look great, with the honeycomb pattern on them, and all the other red accents also accentuate the sporty feel of the cabin.

 The doors of the Aura open wide and the seats are set at a nice height, which makes ingress and egress quite easy. On the inside, you get a dual-tone black and light grey dashboard with the big 8.0-inch touchscreen taking centre stage. The touchscreen has a very user-friendly layout and is quite responsive as well. While there’s no e-SIM that enables connected car features, you do get the iBlue system that allows you to control the stereo via your smartphone. The touchscreen and the instrument cluster are connected by a piano black trim to make it look like a single unit. High quality materials do make the cabin feel premium and what’s even more important is the fact that the fit and finish levels are impressive too.

 The front seats are wide and supportive, but they don’t get adjustable headrests like the Dzire’s. Moreover, the fixed headrests are small, which is uncomfortable for tall drivers. The seats are comfy as the cushioning is on point. However, as the lumbar support is a little excessive it might cause discomfort while driving for long hours. Seated in the rear, the cabin is just marginally roomier than the Xcent’s. In terms of legroom, the Dzire is clearly more spacious, but the Aura doesn’t feel cramped. The long seat squab also provides good under-thigh support. Headroom is adequate for tall passengers however, passengers taller than 6ft might be left wanting for more room. The backrest is set at a nice and comfortable angle and you do get adjustable headrests for rear passengers. A fixed headrest for the middle passenger, like in the Xcent, is missing. The 402-litre boot is quite spacious, but the loading lip is a little high.

 The Aura is offered in five variants, and like we’ve said earlier, it is loaded with features. The turbo-petrol and AMT variants are offered in the SX+ trim while the petrol- and diesel-manual variants are offered in the top-end SX(O) trim. While the difference between the two variants is just cosmetic, the SX+ variant misses out on a leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear knob. Talking about features in these two variants, you have an 8.0-inch touchscreen with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay connectivity, a 5.3-inch MID screen, wireless phone charger, cruise control (top-end petrol manual only), rear ac vents and a 12V charging socket for rear passengers. In terms of safety, the Aura is equipped with dual airbags, ABS with EBD, ISOFIX child seat anchors, emergency stop signal and rear parking sensors with a camera.

 We got to drive the new 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine with a 5-speed manual transmission and the BS6 diesel engine with the 5-speed manual and AMT gearbox. The 1.0-litre, three-cylinder turbo-petrol engine is quiet at idle, but you can still feel the vibrations on the steering wheel and the pedals. Start driving and you will notice that this motor is quite rev-happy and moves through the range quite willingly. The turbo kicks in early, just above 1,800rpm, and provides a strong surge of power. The best part about this engine is its wide powerband, which makes keeping up with traffic and making quick overtakes easy tasks. The engine starts getting audible as you climb up the rev range and gets quite loud beyond 5,000rpm. But since the power keeps coming in strong till almost 6,000rpm and the engine has a hint of sporty growl to it, enthusiasts won’t mind being in the higher revs. Accompanied by a light clutch and gearbox combination, the turbo-petrol is an easy car to drive in a sedate as well as an enthusiastic manner.

 In its BS6 guise, the 1.2-litre, three-cylinder diesel engine is quite refined. At idle, you can hear the diesel clatter though it slowly smoothens out as you start driving. Driving at low speeds isn’t much of a problem as the engine is quite responsive and a strong bottom-end masks turbo lag well. You won’t be shifting through the gears too much while driving through the city. In the mid-range, the engine has good power on tap till 4,000rpm, beyond which it starts losing steam. On the highways while cruising, the diesel runs silently and you won’t have to downshift too often to perform an overtaking manoeuvre. The clutch and gearbox remain effortless and smooth in the diesel variant as well. The AMT unit has a smooth creep function, and while the typical head nod is present, it is better than some of the other AMT units out there. The gearshifts aren’t quick – this has been done to keep the jerk between shifts to a minimum.

 The Aura has MacPherson struts up front and a torsion beam axle at the rear. It rides on 175/60 R15 tyres, all of which makes the ride quality quite absorbent. There is an underlying stiffness to the suspension, which is why sharp potholes and bumps are felt in the cabin. On the highways, the Aura feels quite stable. A point worth mentioning here is that since the diesel has a heavier front-end, it feels more planted than the petrol variant. Similarly, in the corners, the diesel’s steering has that added weight that makes it much nicer to drive. The steering still doesn’t feel connected, but the added weight does allow you to carry more speed into corners. In contrast, the turbo-petrol variant, which is the engine that will be preferred by most enthusiasts, has a lighter steering. The brakes work well in emergency situations and the pedal feel is also progressive, with a nice and strong bite point as soon as you start braking.

 Designed and specified to stand out from the crowd and especially the Maruti Dzire, the Hyundai Aura comes with flashy styling, a powerful and fun turbo-petrol and even a BS6-compliant diesel. It is well equipped and comfortable on the inside. It is powered by capable set of engines that come with AMT automatics too. There’s something for the enthusiast too, as the turbo-petrol variant does have its highlights.

 The Aura is even priced competitively against cars like the Dzire, with prices starting at Rs 5.80 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi) with the diesel in BS6 form only costing Rs 20,000 more than the one on the Xcent. Yes the cabin isn’t as spacious as the competition, the turbo-petrol is a bit expensive at Rs 8.55 lakh and those looking for an automatic version of the turbo-petrol wont get one. Still, the Aura offers so much more in comparison to the competition in certain areas. It seems poised to take a much larger slice of the pie.

1330,0,Tamil ,xyz,"Los Angeles: Federal investigators on Monday sifted through the wreckage of the helicopter crash that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight other people, hoping to find clues to what caused the accident that stunned the world.

 Bryant, 41, was traveling Sunday with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and seven other passengers and crew when the Sikorsky S-76 slammed into a rugged hillside in thick fog in Calabasas, northwest of LA. There were no survivors.

 A five-time NBA champion for his only team, the LA Lakers, and a double Olympic gold medalist, Bryant was widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players in history.

 He was traveling on his private helicopter from Orange County, where he lived, to his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks where his daughter was set to play.

 Jennifer Homendy, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told a press conference that investigators would remain at the site of the crash throughout the week to collect evidence.

 It was a pretty devastating accident scene, she said, adding that the wreckage was strewn across about 600 feet (180 meters).

 We will be here about five days on scene to collect perishable evidence, she said. We are not here to determine the cause of the accident. We will not determine that on scene.

 Homendy said the aircraft did not have a black box, which was not required on that type of helicopter.

 Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva told reporters that it would take a while to recover the remains of the victims because of the force of the crash and the rugged terrain.

 He added that given the number of people trying to access the site unlawfully, his agency has had to resort to police on horseback or all terrain vehicles to secure the area.

 We want to make sure everyone stays where they should be ... and keep everyone safe because the area is dangerous even in daytime because of the steepness of the terrain, he said.

 Philippe Lesourd, a helicopter pilot and instructor who has been flying in California for 29 years, told AFP that the heavy fog likely caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft.

 He said he pilot most probably suffered spatial disorientation after losing sight of the ground upon entering the clouds.

 The fog was heavy enough on Sunday that the Los Angeles Police Department and the sheriffs office grounded their helicopters for part of the day.

 Witnesses told local media the helicopter appeared to be flying very low and seemed to struggle before it slammed into a hillside.

 LA FEELS EMPTY

 Apart from Bryant and his daughter Gianna, the other passengers on the flight included baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife Keri and their daughter Alyssa, who played basketball at the same club as Gianna.

 Christina Mauser, an assistant coach of the Mamba girls basketball team, was also killed along with Sarah and Payton Chester, a mother and daughter.

 News of the crash reverberated across the globe and hundreds gathered at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, where Bryant wowed fans for 20 years, placing flowers, candles and messages for their fallen hero.

 Its unbelievable that he is gone, said Esmeralda Cisneros. Everyone feels empty. California and LA feel empty without him.

 Tributes have also flooded in from former US presidents, pop stars and athletes from different sports, a sign of how the man known as the Black Mamba had transcended basketball.

 The NBA announced that it had postponed Tuesdays Lakers game against the Los Angeles Clipper in the wake of the tragedy.

 Bryants career began in 1996, straight out of high school. On top of his NBA championship wins, he helped the US squad of all-stars to Olympic titles in 2008 in Beijing and 2012 in London.

 FAIRYTALE FAREWELL

 Bryant bowed out of the NBA in 2016, scoring 60 points in a fairytale farewell appearance at the Staples Center.

 The son of former NBA player Joe Jellybean Bryant, the Lakers legend was born in Philadelphia while his father played for the 76ers.

 The elder Bryant played from 1984 to 1991 in Italy, giving young Kobe a global worldview as he grew up dreaming of following his dad into the NBA.

 He would eventually join the ranks of professionals at the age of 17, jumping directly into the NBA, only the sixth player to make such a leap.

 At 18, Bryant became, at the time, the youngest player or starter in an NBA game and the youngest winner of the NBA Slam Dunk Contest.

 With Bryant alongside Shaquille ONeal, the Lakers captured three straight NBA crowns from 2000-2002, returning the team to glory days unseen since 1988.

 Bryants career was almost derailed in 2003 when he was arrested in Colorado over a sexual assault complaint filed by a 19-year-old hotel employee where Bryant was staying ahead of knee surgery.

 He admitted to adultery but denied an accusation of rape and the case was dropped in 2004 after the accuser refused to testify.

 A separate civil suit was settled under terms kept private.

 After his playing career, Bryant branched out into the entertainment industry.

 In 2018, he won an Oscar for his animated short film Dear Basketball, a love letter to the sport which brought him fame and fortune. The film was made available online for free on Monday.

1331,0,Telugu,xyz,"Chandigarh: A 28-year-old Mohali resident has been admitted at Chandigarhs Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research with coronavirus-like symptoms. The patient is a banker and had travelled to a province near Chinas Wuhan, the epicentre of the deadly virus.

 According to a Times of India report, the patient who had gone to the emergency was admitted to the hospitals isolation ward for communicable diseases. The patient is a suspected case and has been admitted to the isolation ward. His blood samples have been sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune, PGIMER director Prof Jagat Ram was quoted as saying.

 The report stated that the mans family members have been quarantined at home. He had come with complaint of breathlessness and chest congestion to the emergency. The ministry of health and family welfare has also been informed about the case, said a PGI official.

 Some reports have stated the symptoms of the infections as runny nose, sore throat, headache, fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, especially for those with weak immune system. There are currently no vaccines available to protect people against the infection that can be transmitted from human to human.

 The deadly coronavirus also affected people in China, Australia, Cambodia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, United States, France and Germany.

 In India, some suspected cases are under observation. However, there has been no confirmation yet.

 The Civil Aviation Ministry had directed seven airports, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata, to make arrangements for screening of passengers arriving from China in the wake of outbreak of the infection.

 Airlines flying in from any airport in China including Hong Kong have been asked to make in-flight announcements requesting passengers with history of fever and cough and travel to Wuhan city in the past 14 days to self-declare at the port of arrival in order to facilitate early isolation, an official statement issued last week state.

1332,0,Hindi,abc,"KL Rahul lifted the Player of the Match trophy for his unbeaten knock of 57 on Sunday in Auckland where India chased down New Zealands score of 132/5 in the second T20I with 7 wickets and 15 deliveries to spare. Although Rahuls handy innings in the run chase earned him an award, someone wasnt happy.

 Former cricketer turned commentator Sanjay Manjrekar took to his Twitter account to express his displeasure with the trophy being awarded to a batsman instead of a bowler.

 Manjrekar wrote: Player of the match should have been a bowler.

 Player of the match should have been a bowler. #INDvNZ

 What Manjrekar was suggesting was that the Indian bowlers kept it tight and restricted the Kiwis to a paltry score of 132, hence it was an easier chase for the visitors.

 While the frontline Indian pacers Mohammad Shami and Jasprit Bumrah kept things below run a ball, it was the all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja who was the pick of the bowlers, scalping 2 Kiwi wickets and giving away only 18 in his designated 4 overs.

 Jadeja removed the dangerous New Zealander skipper Kane Williamson and Colin de Grandhomme, hence giving no momentum whatsoever to the home side.

 Was Manjrekar suggesting that Jadeja was a better contender for the Player of the Match trophy? Curious to know, Jadeja seemingly in a goofy mood, himself took to Twitter to clear the air and ask the commentator to name names in his otherwise cryptic tweet.

 What is the name of that bowler?? Pls pls mention

 If you have just arrived to the party, Manjrekar-Jadejas not-so-light-hearted banter dates back to last year where the former had called Jadeja bits and pieces cricketer after India lost to England in a World Cup contest.

 I am not a big fan of bits and pieces players which Jadeja is at this point of his career in 50-over cricket. In Test matches, he is a pure bowler. But in 50-over cricket, I would rather have a batsman and a spinner, Manjrekar told IANS.

 Not the one to mince words, Jadeja gave it back to Manjrekar on the microblogging site, saying he had played for India in far more matches than him.

 Still i have played twice the number of matches you have played and i m still playing. Learn to respect ppl who have achieved.i have heard enough of your verbal diarrhoea.@sanjaymanjrekar

 Since the ugly spat, cricket fans have been backing Jadeja in the popcorn-worthy clash, especially when the Indian all-rounder is out in the middle while Manjrekar is performing his commentating duties from the box.

 This was in full display during Men in Blues final group stage encounter with the Lankans at the 2019 World Cup in England where Jadeja, bowling his first over of the match and the World Cup, deceived Kusal Mendis in the 11th over and Dhoni completed a routine stumping.

 If you ever thought your existence was painful, just switch on the TV & watch Manjrekar doing commentary while Jadeja is bowling beautifully #INDvSL

 Meanwhile, New Zealand will meet India on Wednesday in the third T20I at Seddon Park in Hamilton in a bid to keep the series alive.

 India lead the 5-match T20I series 2-0 after Auckland win.

1333,0,Telugu,xyz,"When I say compact sedan from Hyundai, well, you might be thinking of the Hyundai Xcent. Well, that car has a successor now, in the form of the Hyundai Aura which, if you haven’t made out already, is based on the Grand i10 Nios. But there are new things that are being offered with this car to make it lucrative to the compact sedan buyer in India. So we took it out for a drive to find out what are these new features, how is it to drive and to find out the answer to the big question – whether this is going to be worth your money?

 Let’s start with the design of the Hyundai Aura. While from the front it looks similar to the Grand i10 Nios, it does get a redesigned bumper and different detailing to the grille, which has been given a silver bezel. You also get the same swept-back projector headlamps along with projector fog lamps but perhaps the biggest differentiator from the front is the fact that the Aura gets twin Boomerang-shaped LED DRLs instead of one that you get on the Grand i10 Nios.

 Coming to the sides, the Aura gets newly designed alloy wheels which look fantastic and the car sports a coupe-like roofline that tapers towards the boot, which itself has a pinched-up look making it look properly sporty. The C-Pillar has been given a gloss-black finish to give the Aura a floating roof design.

 Coming to the back, it gets Z-shaped LED tail lamps which get a chrome garnish in between to make them look connected.

 While from the front, the Aura looks good, it is from the sides and the rear where the design can come across as a bit polarizing. However, we can say that the Aura does look better in the flesh than in the pictures.

 Coming to the inside of the Aura, the moment you step in, the first thing that will come to your mind is the Grand i10 Nios as the cabin is almost identical in terms of design. However, Hyundai has taken the effort to give it its own treatment. Like the seats now get a different texture and also, the dash uses bronze inserts which look a lot better. You still get the good bits like the honeycomb pattern on the dash, doors and around the gear lever.

 The use of lighter shades inside the cabin make it look upmarket and premium, however, the cabin and the seat upholstery will require special care as time goes to maintain a clean look. You still have an ample amount of storage compartments all across the cabin. In terms of features, the Aura gets things like wireless charging for the top-spec variant, automatic climate control, a semi-digital instrument cluster that shows pretty much everything you need to know and there is also an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system that has a good touch response and is intuitive to use. It also supports Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. What’s new with the Aura is that the top-end petrol variants also come with Cruise control.

 So for those seated at the front, it’s a nice cabin space to be in. And the same goes for those seated at the back as well.

 Adjusting the driver seat to my height of 5’10, I still had a good amount of legroom, knee room, shoulder room and a decent amount of headroom. This is one of the most spacious cabins in its segment in terms of width and you won’t have any problems having three people sit at the back. Also, the under-thigh support is nice too. But, what’s new in the Aura is that now you get an armrest as well.

 But coming to the all-important part, which is the driving experience.

 Hyundai is offering the Aura with three engine options. There is a 1.2-litre petrol engine that is offered with a choice of 5-speed manual or a 5-speed AMT gearbox. Then there is the 1.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine which is the most powerful of the lot that comes with only a 5-speed manual gearbox option and finally, there’s the drivetrain that we drove – 1.2-litre diesel engine with a 5-speed manual gearbox. And yes, this gets an AMT gearbox option too.

 The diesel engine makes 75 PS of power and 190 Nm of torque. But what’s special about this engine is the fact that this is a BS-VI emission-norm compliant motor. This means that come April 1, 2020, the Hyundai Aura will be one of the few diesel-engine powered compact sedans that will be on sale in India. As for the driving bit, the engine is refined and has a healthy spread of power and torque across the RPM band.

 In case of the quick overtakes, you won’t feel the need to downshift every time. We also found the suspension setup coped well with low-speed bumps and had a stable ride at highways speeds as well. The Aura feels even better at city speeds thanks to the light clutch and steering that makes it easy to tackle city traffic. All in all, the Aura leaves a positive first impression at almost all fronts.

 So to wrap it up, having spent the day driving around in this car, it offers a familiar driving experience, which is to say that this is a good car to drive around in. It will do the job in the city and you can take it out on the highways too. As for the features, it gets everything that other cars in this segment offer. As for the looks, that is a subjective matter. You have to decide whether this works for you or not. At the end of the day, this is a good value for money car and we recommend going for the diesel variant or the 1.0-litre petrol engine variant.

1334,0,Tamil ,xyz,"Ujjain: A suspected corona virus case has been reported from Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain town as a youth who has been studying MBBS in China’s Wuhan city has been hospitalised with suspicious symptoms of the disease that has scared thousands in neighbouring China.

 A native of Ujjain, the youth had reached India on Jan 13 after leaving Wuhan on Jan 11. Wuhan is considered to be the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak.

 Meanwhile, after showing suspected symptoms like cough, cold and fever, the youth has been taken to Madhav Nagar hospital and his blood samples hve been sent for further examination.

 Ujjain collector Shashank Misra too reached the hospital on Tuesday and enquired about the health of the youth. Speaking to the media, Misra said that the blood samples of the youth have been taken and further action would be taken after the report is received by evening. The locals who were in touch with the youth in Ujjain are also being monitored, said the collector.

 The youth speaking to News18, however, claimed that he studies MBBS in Wuhan city and claimed that he was least likely to be affected with the virus as he is a vegetarian. It is believed that the virus has spread among humans through sea food.

 The medical staff of the hospital claimed that the youth was admitted to the hospital on Monday afternoon and has been kept under monitoring in isolation ward. As a preventive measure, the mother of the MBBS student too has been kept under observation at the government hospital.

 An alert has been sounded by the Health department in Bhopal and an isolation ward is being made in Hamidia hospital in Bhopal to screen suspected patients.

1335,0,Telugu,xyz,"After the Citizenship Amendment Act was passed as a law on December 11, 2019, the country has been rocked by nation-wide protests.

 The law which seeks to amend the definition of illegal immigrant for Hindu, Sikh, Parsi, Buddhist and Christian immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have lived in India without documentation. The protesters have alleged that the law is anti-secular for not providing citizenship for Muslims, discriminating against them on religious grounds.

 In the midst of this, a priest in Telangana has demanded citizenship under the CAA, for the diety.

 The head priest at Chilkoor Balaji Temple on the banks of Osman Sagar in Hyderabad, CS Rangarajan, has asked for citizenship for the deity Balaji Lord Venkateswara.

 “Give citizenship to the deity of the famous Chilkur temple Balaji Lord Venkateswara, Rangarajan told The Times of India.

 His argument was the same as one used for Ram Lalla in court: Every deity is considered a minor and has to be represented in court by a priest, trustee or the executive officer. Under Section 5(4) of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act a minor can obtain citizenship rights, so deities of all the temples can be given citizenship rights under this provision. Register all Hindu deities like Venkateswara Swamy in Tirumala, Ayyappa Swamy in Sabarimala, and Padmanabhaswamy in Kerala as citizens under Section 5(4) of CAA, he argued.

 The Chilkur Balaji Temple is popularly known as Visa Balaji Temple, is one of the oldest temples in Hyderabad built during the time of Madanna and Akkanna, the uncles of Bhakta Ramadas.

 The temple was nicknamed such after it became popular for granting wishes for clearing US visa.

 Ganesh Acharya is back in news for the wrong reasons. A 33-year-old assistant female choreographer has filed a complaint against him at the Maharashtra Womens Commission and Amboli police station in Mumbai of depriving her of working in the film industry, demanding commission from income and forcing her to watch adult videos.

 In her complaint, the woman mentioned that Ganesh has been harassing her continuously ever since he was appointed as the General Secretary of the Indian Film & Television Choreographers Association. She further claimed that he misused his position to get her membership removed from the association when she didnt listen to him.

 The female choreographer further accused Ganesh of forcing her to watch adult videos. She said that Ganesh used to make inappropriate comments on her and would also ask her to watch porn videos, which she never agreed.

 She also claimed that he has been mentally harassing her ever since she didnt give in to his pressure of shelling out extra Rs 500 out of her share money just like the rest of the dancers.

 This is not the first time Ganesh has hit a controversy. Earlier, he had an ugly spat with veteran choreographer, Saroj Khan where she accused him of using his position to manipulate dancers and malign the old association (CDA). In reply, the choreographer hit back at her accusations and said, Saroj ji is speaking wrong. When the CDA was closed why did not she came to help us to open it.

1338,0,English,abc,"NEW DELHI: Data Security Council of India (DSCI) and Chinese short-video making app TikTok on Monday have come together to launch an interactive and informative quiz for its community online.

 The quiz will go live on the app on January 28 and will run until February 3. It also aims to appraise users on best practices for online privacy and protection.

 In line with the theme of the 2020 edition of Data Privacy Day – ‘Privacy is Everyone’s Responsibility’, the in-app quiz asks users interesting questions pertaining to their awareness of online privacy and its importance.

 “On the occasion of Data Privacy Day, we stay committed to building a privacy-aware society. We are confident that our partnership with TikTok will help us land the message of safe and secure online data practices, far and wide,” said Rama Vedashree, CEO, DSCI.

 According to Global Web Index’s Social Media Trends 2019 report, Indian users spent 2.4 hours on social media, in line with the global average.

 With the rising data consumption and increase in time spent online, it is important that the users are aware of privacy practices and principles that are keys to adhere to.

 “We are honoured to partner with DSCI and spread awareness about the safety and privacy best practices amongst our users,” said Subi Chaturvedi, Head, ‘TikTok for Good-India’.

 “As part of ‘TikTok For Good’, we look forward to launching more such initiatives that have a larger positive impact on society, harnessing the power of technology and celebrating privacy by design at the core of everything we do,” Chaturvedi added. (IANS)

1339,0,English,xyz,"NEW DELHI: From cops on duty to young lads in small-town India, Chinese short-video making app TikTok has become a rising phenomenon, owing to a strong local network while providing marketers with a platform to reach millions of untapped users.

 TikTok has 700 million users globally, out of which over 200 million are now in India, and growing exponentially. Despite being pulled by the law enforcement agencies for vitiating the digital atmosphere in the country, TikTok has created its own fan following and US players like Facebook and its apps WhatsApp and Instagram are a worried lot.

 Global market research firm Forrester estimates that short video ad spending for the key Asia Pacific markets of Australia, China, India, Japan and South Korea is likely to hit $4.7 billion in 2019.

 “TikTok’s success among non-Chinese consumers is partly due to its ability to adapt to domestic markets from a content and cultural point of view. In India, TikTok has its own local team that plans and monitors content specifically for younger demographics. This has attracted a high number of active users on its platform,” explains Meenakshi Tiwari, Forecast Analyst at Forrester.

 Alibaba-backed Paytm has shown how Chinese bigwigs create space in a country, without actually being physically present there. China’s financial services company Ant Financial, an affiliate of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holdings, owns nearly 38 per cent in One97 Communications, which is the parent company of Paytm which has over 200 million users.

 After failing to create an impact in the ecommerce space while burning cash in Paytm Mall, Alibaba has now launched Yoli app which is an aggregator platform where users can find the best deals being offered on Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Paytm Mall, Tata Cliq, Bigbasket, Snapdeal and more. The app has been downloaded over a million times on Google Play Store.

 Chinese B2B e-commerce platform Club Factory last week surpassed 100 million monthly active users (MAUs) in India — mostly from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Telangana.

 According to Vincent Lou, Founder and CEO, Club Factory, the company managed to reduce delivery time by as much as 30 per cent with average positive product rating going up by 40 per cent in 2019. “Returns or product exchange on the platform have dropped by almost 25 per cent, said Lou.

 As of December 2019, Club Factory’s registered local seller base stands close to 30,000.

 The aim, like TikTok, is clear: Create a niche space especially in small-town India and stay afloat.

 According to Satish Meena, Senior Forecast Analyst with Forrester, round one of the Indian ecommerce battle went to Amazon and Flipkart but round two definitely belongs to the Chinese companies.

 “Things are different when it comes to the Chinese way of doing business. They are competing to win new customers in India in the ecommerce space which are not yet on Amazon or Flipkart, by offering heavy discounts and selling cheap. Club Factory is exactly doing this and gaining users fast,” said Meena.

 “The upcoming battle will happen in the social ecommerce and content space in India and Chinese are too good at that, by offering different products at affordable prices and targeting tier II and III towns where they can easily sell such products,” Meena elaborated.

 The challenge, however, is a seamless logistics chain for the cross-border ecommerce.

 “Logistics is a big hurdle for them as these costs have to be low in order to make profits. Chinese ecommerce players like Club Factory, Shein and JollyC have created an initial buzz, but it is to be seen how serious they are and what value addition they would eventually bring to the country,” Meena noted.

 In December, the government came down heavily on the Chinese cross-border e-commerce firms for using the “gift” route to export orders and avoid paying customs duty.

 The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) banned import of goods under the “gift” route in a notification, saying these companies will now have to pay the duty, even on “gifts and samples” valued at under Rs 5,000.

 According to a latest report by the E-Commerce Council of India (TECI) and ChannelPlay, fueled by low data tariffs, affordable smartphones and growing Internet usage, the size of the Indian e-commerce market is likely to reach $230 billion in a decade.

 Another 40-50 crore shoppers are expected to come online in 10 years, joining the nearly 10 crore online shoppers in India.

 Chinese ecommerce giants know this well that aspirational India is the next fertile ground for their growth and before US giants win them over, the Dragon has set the ball rolling. (IANS)

 Welcome to this weeks edition of Things WWE subtly told us on RAW. It was a good episode and the first RAW to kick off the road to WrestleMania. With less than 69 days left for the Grandest Stage of Them All, WWE wasted no time in planting the seeds for the show of shows.

 The big excitement, of course, was surrounding Drew McIntyre, Edge, and to a smaller extent - Charlotte Flair. It appears that a few feuds have wrapped up, while some continued and some intensified.

 What we know for sure is that the build to WrestleMania is going to be a promising one. Ultimately, it all depends on how it works out in the aftermath of the Saudi Arabia show on February 27th.

 Were a bit confused as to why there wont be a Womens match on a PPV but we cant expect that at Super ShowDown, even if they had a token match last time. Either way, here are a few things that WWE subtly told us on RAW.

1341,0,Gujarati,abc,"Come January, and expectations from the Budget soar high for every taxpayer. While an increase in taxable ceiling, enhancement of deduction limits remain permanent expectations from each Budget, this year these asks assume more significance.

 Zita, a newly-promoted senior-level executive in a multinational company has been offered a lucrative package with built-in cherries such as stock rewards with her elevation. This has not only motivated her to sharpen her leadership skills but to also develop an interest in her tax matters with the new components introduced. She, however, has several questions troubling her, based on discussions with her peers.

 Does the surcharge bring down the super-rich to rich?

 Presently, the slab rate is as high as 30 percent for income exceeding Rs 10 lakh and the additional surcharge results in a whopping effective tax rate of 42.744 percent at this level. Surcharges range from 10 to 37 percent for incomes over Rs 50 lakh to Rs 5 crore. As a salaried employee enjoys limited deductions compared to a professional or corporate entity, it is reasonable for Zita to hope for lower tax slab rates.

 Echoing these sentiments, most individuals expect the income slabs to rise, the effective tax rate to be rationalised specially for the mid-income group. With changes being brought in year after year, India’s taxation system has become very complex, difficult to comprehend and recall. A tax framework that is simple to understand and implement, is what most taxpayers wish for.

 Can Budget amendments motivate employee mobility?

 What can Zita expect from a taxation perspective, if she is sent on a short-term overseas trip? The mobile population in India is significant and needs focussed attention in terms of tax relief, avoidance of double taxation and procedural relaxation. Over the past few years, the Budget has been proposing additional compliances, especially with respect to reporting of overseas assets, and claims of treaty relief.

 Representational image. Reuters

 Official foreign travel typically results in compliances in more than one country. Taxation is triggered based on the country of residence and/or source. While there are quite a few relief measures available in double taxation avoidance agreements, it would really help if local laws clarify and provide for exemption or credits to avoid double taxation.

 Employers should be able to claim credits for taxes paid in the overseas location as part of the payroll process and the tax laws and rules should provide a framework to do the same to avoid disputes. Under current laws, these are not expressly provided. Further, the Budget could introduce a special regime for inbound employees at a fixed rate and nil taxes for outbound employees where the services are rendered outside India, subject to prescribed conditions. This is quite common in European taxation in the form of an Expatriate Tax Regime. Such a move would make India an attractive location for foreign talent.

 The next critical aspect is regarding stock rewards. When an employee takes up assignments outside India, the benefit from stock options has to be pro-rated based on the assignment tenure in each country during the vesting period. This principle is not expressly stated in income tax laws. Hence, some companies reduce taxes on the entire income instead of income only attributable to the India service period. This increases the tax outflow for the employee. Explicit provisions in income tax laws can remove such ambiguity. The valuation basis for stock rewards where the stock is on an overseas stock exchange is also complex and is arrived at based on a Category I merchant banker’s certificate. Adopting stock price from an overseas stock exchange could help ease the procedural complexity.

 Can the tax laws provide more for individuals?

 In addition to the rationalisation of slab rates, individual taxpayers expect an overall enhancement of deduction limits, for instance under Section 80C. The deduction limit of Rs 150,000 is generally exhausted with contributions to provident fund, NPS, life insurance premium, housing loan repayments, etc. The government may consider increasing the limit based on the nature of expenditure and investment which aligns with the objectives of the government. The deduction for investment in infrastructure bonds, for instance, can also be restored to stimulate spend on infrastructure.

 Individuals form the fulcrum in enhancing consumption in the economy, and a reduction in taxes would definitely pave the way to boost purchasing capacity. Hope Budget 2020 will reward Zita’s expectations with a fatter take-home paycheck by slashing her tax outgo and winning her support in growing the economy.

 Tonights edition of Monday Night RAW didnt exactly end as Edge had planned. The WWE Hall of Famer came out to a thunderous ovation and addressed his shocking return last night at the Royal Rumble. Soon after, Edges former tag team partner Randy Orton came out and the segment ended with Orton destroying The Rated-R Superstar in the middle of the ring.

 The heinous attack didnt sit well with the fans one bit and Orton was showered with a loud chorus of boos and chants of a**hole. WWE has now posted an update on Edge, on its official website.

 Following Ortons dastardly attack on Edge, its now being reported that the former Tag Team Champions will face off at WrestleMania 36 in Tampa, Florida. Both WWE veterans have a lot of history together, and were once the best of friends. The duo took on Triple H and Shawn Michaels back in 2006 in a long feud. Last night, Orton and Edge had a wholesome chat during the Rumble match. They worked as a team for some time in the match before Edge eliminated The Viper from the match.

 “I would like to resign as an Independent Director of the Bank with effect from January 27, 2020. Consequently, I shall also cease to be a member of various Board Committees of the Bank,” he wrote in the letter.

 Bansal, who founded Navi Technologies after moving out of Flipkart in 2018, will now focus on the financial services sector, including insurance and banking. Earlier this month, Navi Technologies said its microfinance arm, Chaitanya India Fin Credit Pvt. Ltd (CIFCPL), has formally approached the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for a universal banking licence.

 “Given an entity owned and controlled by me has made an application to the RBI for a universal banking license, I felt it was — in the interest of propriety and corporate governance — only appropriate that I stepped down from this role,” he said, adding that there is no other material reason for his resignation.

 The bank confirmed that it has received Bansals resignation letter dated January 27 and the Board of Directors has taken note of it.

1344,0,Hindi,pqr,"I usually don’t spend my morning whiling away time watching YouTube videos. And I most certainly don’t waste my time writing about them. But this one is a bit different. Truly different. Motorola has released a bunch of videos about the upcoming foldable phone, the Moto Razr and it probably wants you to watch all. YouTube video views, you know. I won’t, except one that stands out. It is titled “Caring for razr” and this 43 second gem caught my eye (You can also see this masterpiece here). Secret tip (you’ll thank me for this): keep the volume of your earbuds, earphones, headphones or speakers low, because the video starts out with really loud music. How about gently easing into things, folks? Anyway, we eventually get to the point of actually learning to care about a smartphone (we have probably been doing it all wrong over the years, have we?) after about 7 seconds of montage shots.

 So, we start out with the first tip. It says: Razr is water repellent; wipe with a dry cloth if wet. I truly did not know that one. Oh dear, how have my phones, including a bunch if iPhones survived over the years. And we move on to the bombshell. Motorola says: Screen is made to bend; bumps and lumps are normal. Ouch. The screen is made to bend, well, because it’s a foldable phone. Tell me something new. Oh wait, you already did! Apparently, “bumps and lumps” are normal on a foldable phone, as you use it.

 Motorola doesn’t stop there. They say that the screen of the Moto Razr foldable phone has protective coating. That is probably to warn us that we don’t need to peel off any protective layer thinking it is meant to come off, and neither do we need to plaster another screen protector on top of it. Good one. Should also come as a note in the box. Hopefully it will.

 Avoid sharp objects. That is Motorola’s next advice. Amidst the really loud music, they don’t say what exactly they mean by this. As in don’t keep sharp-ish objects in the same trouser pocket as you slide the Moto Razr (you should actually make that a habit) into or not poke the phone with a sharp object (you do that?). Oh no, how will I play darts now? Bummer.

 We are just at 24 seconds on the timeline right now. This will be a long morning.

 Oh, now Motorola says, “Don’t use a screen protector.” Umm, did no one actually make a proper script of this video? Anyway.

 Next piece of advice: Close the phone before putting it in the pocket or purse. Ah, yes. Sure. Clearly, Motorola realizes the Razr will be fragile, irrespective of the brave face they put up in public.

 And amidst still very loud music, we end the masterpiece. I need a coffee now.

 Also Read | Samsung Galaxy Fold Review: Resistance is Futile, Just Go And Buy One If You Can

 But before I go fix a cup for myself, let us just rewind to the Samsung Galaxy Fold. It started out in life with a serious issue where bumps and lumps showed up on the foldable screen of some of the initial units shared with the media. The same sort of “bumps and lumps” that Moto says isn’t a problem and you shouldn’t bother. If Samsung’s Galaxy Fold saga and how it unfolded is anything to go by, it could be a big problem. Samsung was roundly criticized for it, but credit where it is due, the company went back to the drawing board and returned with a foldable phone which really offers an unparalleled smartphone usage experience. And no, the Galaxy Fold has no bumps and lumps to speak of. Motorola has talked about the hard-protective coating to protect the plastic OLED display, but how good it really is, will only become clear once the phone is put through the paces. Admittedly, Moto has experience with those sorts of displays, going as far back as 2011.

 As you probably chew on what Motorola has said in this video, remember what a Motorola executive told The Verge when they launched the phone in November, “We’re not going to go out there and say, ‘consumers should be cautious of how they use the phone.’” What do you really trust?

The film is facing tough competition from Ajay Devgn-Saif Ali Khan’s Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior and Varun Dhawan-Shraddha Kapoor’s Street Dancer 3D at the box office and that has majorly impacted its collections.

 Till the first weekend, Panga has raked in collections as 14.91 crores. While Sunday was a huge day for the sports drama with 6.60 crores coming in, Kangana Ranaut’s film today has faced a major dip with the collections remaining across the 1 crore mark. As per the early trends flowing in, Panga has added 1-1.50 crores more to its kitty.

 The film’s overall collections now stand between 15.91-16.41 crores. It will now be necessary to stay above the 1 crore mark throughout the upcoming weekdays or the film will shortly be off the ticket windows.

 Directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, Panga also features Neena Gupta, Richa Chadha and Jassie Gill. The film which hit the screens on January 24, revolves around a kabaddi player, played by Kangana, who wants to make a comeback in the game after marriage and motherhood.

 Actress Kangana Ranaut feels India skipper Virat Kohli is the most fearless player in the national cricket team.

 “I am the Panga queen, and the Panga king of Team India is definitely Virat Kohli. He is fearless and is up for any challenges that come his way. This time we both will take a ‘Panga’ on the same day – mine will be at the theatres, and he will battle it out against New Zealand team on their home ground. This will be fun,” Kangana said while promoting her upcoming film.

1348,0,Tamil ,abc,"GST collections have crossed Rs 1 lakh crore mark for the third month in a row in January 2020. GST collection recorded in January 2020 is likely to be between Rs 1.08 lakh crore to Rs 1.13 lakh crore, CNBC TV-18 reported unidentified sources as saying. After the collections rose to over Rs 1 lakh crore in November, this is the third time that collections have swollen. Previously, the gross GST revenue collected in December 2019 stood at Rs 1,03,184 crore, government data showed. This was a 9% on-year jump in goods and services tax collections as in December 2018, the GST collection stood at Rs 97,276 crore.

 Out of Rs 1.03 lakh crore collected last month, the CGST collection was at Rs 19,962 crore; SGST stood at Rs 26,792 crore; IGST was at Rs 48,099 crore and cess was at Rs 8,331 crore (including Rs 847 crore collected on imports), a statement by the government said. The collections were highest from Maharashtra among Indian states, followed by Karnataka. However, even with collection over one lakh crore for the last three months, the majority of the states are still likely to fall short of their annual targets for GST collection.

 Meanwhile, the government had fixed the Central Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection budget for fiscal 2019-20 at Rs 6,63,343 crore. The government had achieved half of this target by October 2019, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur had earlier said in the Lok Sabha, PTI reported. He added that the government calculates shortfall or excess in collection of GST after completion of the financial year. The budget estimate for direct taxes for the same fiscal is pegged at Rs 13,35,000 crore. The net collection of direct taxes stood at Rs 5,18,084 crore during April-October, 2019. “The exercise for preparation of budget estimate for 2020-21 and revised estimates for 2019-20 is underway. At this stage, it may be premature to assess the revised estimate against the budget estimate for 2019-20 with respect to taxes,” Anurag Singh Thakur said earlier.

 The airline is awaiting necessary approvals from the ministries of External Affairs and Health to operate the special evacuation flight, the source said. The decision follows the government instructions to various ministries to take steps to deal with the issue.

 “We have kept a Boeing 747-400 ready in Mumbai to operate an evacuation flight to China whenever we get a go ahead from the government,” the source said. Some 250 Indians are to be evacuated, the source said, adding, “we are awaiting clearances from Ministry of External Affairs and also from Health Ministry. The Health Ministry’s nod is required because the operating crew has to fly in a virus outbreak territory.”

 At the Cabinet Secretary meeting on Monday, the government decided that steps may be taken to prepare for the possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan. Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus in China is a novel strain and not seen before.

 Government also asked the Civil Aviation Ministry to issue instruction to airlines for managing and notifying anybody reporting illness on all direct and indirect flight to China besides facilitating in-flight announcements and distribution of health cards to all flights with direct or indirect connectivity to China.

 Officials said Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities for evacuation of Indian nationals, mostly students, stuck in Wuhan city. “It was decided that steps may be taken to prepare for possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan. Accordingly, Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities,” a government statement said.

 Wuhan along 12 other cities have been completely sealed by the Chinese authorities to stop the virus from spreading. The death toll climbed to 80 with 2,744 confirmed cases. Over 250 to 300 Indian students are reportedly stuck in Wuhan triggering concerns over their well-being.

 Out of the total registered electorate, 30.85 lakh are men and 30.88 lakh women, whereas, 69 voters are from the third gender.

1355,0,Hindi,pqr,"Rain lashed parts of Delhi on Tuesday as the air quality remained in the “very poor” category in several areas of the national capital.

 Air quality was “very poor” category in Anand Vihar and “poor” category in Punjabi Bagh, Lodhi Road and ITO, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).

 The Air Quality Index (AQI) was at 338 in Anand Vihar, 341 in Rohini and at 339 in Mundka—all three in the “very poor” category according to the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) data.

 Air quality in Delhi had deteriorated on Monday to “very poor” on the CPCB scale. The CPCB’s AQI read 345 on Monday. It was mainly due to the reduction in wind speed from over 20kmph on January 23 to less than 10kmph, the minimum wind speed required in Delhi to disperse pollutants.

 Los Angeles, January 28: Kobe Bryants 13-year-old daughter Gianna, who died alongside her father in the helicopter crash that claimed the life of the NBA legend, had shown signs that she could further her fathers glittering basketball legacy.

 Her proud father once said the second-born of the Los Angeles Lakers stars four daughters with wife Vanessa was something else on the basketball court.

 Bryants eldest daughter, 17-year-old Natalia, prefers volleyball, Bianka is only three and Capri was only born last year. So the 41-year-old NBA greats basketball hopes were invested in Gianna. Kobe Bryant Demise: Comedy Central Deletes Episode of 2016 Animated TV Show Legends Depicting NBA Stars Death In A Helicopter Crash.

 Its a trip to see her move and the expressions she makes. Its a trip how genetics work, Bryant told US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel in 2018.

 The best thing that happens is when we go out and fans would come up to me and shell be standing next to me... and theyll be like, Youve gotta have a boy, you and V. gotta have a boy.

 You gotta have somebody to carry on your tradition, the legacy. She (Gianna) is like, I got this. Im like, thats right, he went on.

 Yes, you do, you got this. Giannas passion for basketball meant she was often pictured sitting alongside her father at games, watching his beloved Lakers at the Staples Center or the WNBA team Los Angeles Sparks.

 She often worked out with her father in the gymnasium of the familys villa in Newport Beach and he took pride in coaching her high school team when his schedule permitted.

 Gianna was on the helicopter that crashed because she was travelling to a tournament in the Los Angeles suburbs to play for her team, called the Mamba Team, after one of her fathers nicknames.

 One of her teammates was also on board the helicopter and was also among the dead. Giannas future had already been mapped out -- her heart was set on going to Connecticut, the most prestigious womens basketball program in the US.

 And of course, she had introductions that other young girls players could only dream of -- her fathers former agent Rob Pelinka introduced her to basketball stars and coaches.

 Derek Fisher, a Lakers teammate of her father and now coach of the WNBA Sparks, had noticed that Kobes steely will to win had rubbed off on Gianna.

 They have the similar demeanor and personality, Fisher said.

The film is facing tough competition from Ajay Devgn-Saif Ali Khan’s Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior and Varun Dhawan-Shraddha Kapoor’s Street Dancer 3D at the box office and that has majorly impacted its collections.

 Till the first weekend, Panga has raked in collections as 14.91 crores.

 The film’s overall collections now stand between 15.91-16.41 crores. It will now be necessary to stay above the 1 crore mark throughout the upcoming weekdays or the film will shortly be off the ticket windows.

 Directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, Panga also features Neena Gupta, Richa Chadha and Jassie Gill. The film which hit the screens on January 24, revolves around a kabaddi player, played by Kangana, who wants to make a comeback in the game after marriage and motherhood.

 Actress Kangana Ranaut feels India skipper Virat Kohli is the most fearless player in the national cricket team.

 “I am the Panga queen, and the Panga king of Team India is definitely Virat Kohli. He is fearless and is up for any challenges that come his way.

1364,0,Hindi,xyz,"New Delhi: A day after Union Minister Anurag Singh Thakur invited Election Commissions attention with his controversial remarks on anti-Citizenship Act protesters, now another BJP leader has triggered a row with his shocking statement on those protesting against the new Act.

 In an interview to news agency ANI on Tuesday (January 28), BJP MP Parvesh Verma said, Lakhs of people gather there [Shaheen Bagh]. People of Delhi will have to think and make a decision. They will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them. Parvesh Verma added, Theres time today, Modi Ji and Amit Shah wont come to save you tomorrow.

 The BJP MP openly threatened Shaheen Bagh protesters as he addressed a rally in west Delhis Ranhoula village under Vikaspuri assembly on January 27. Verma said if the BJP is voted to power in Delhi, it will only take an hour to clear off protests in Shaheen Bagh.

 This election [Delhi poll] is not a small election but that for stability and unity of the country. If a government of the Bharatiya Janata Party is formed on the February 11, then after an hour no one will be seen in Shaheen Bagh, said West Delhi BJP MP Parvesh Verma.

 Live TV

 Verma added that within one month all existing mosques built on government land in his constituency will be demolished if the Bharatiya Janata Party comes to power in Delhi this year.

 On January 27, BJP leader and Union minister Anurag Thakur sparked a row after he egged on participants of an election rally to raise an incendiary slogan that traitors should be shot, as he lashed out at anti-CAA protestors.

 At the rally, the minister of state for finance, shouted desh ke gaddaron ko to which the crowd responded goli maro sa*** ko (shoot down the traitors).

 The controversial slogan has been raised by some junior BJP leaders of late, including Kapil Mishra, but this is the first time a party functionary of the level of a Union minister has participated in it. Thakur is also heard telling the crowd to raising the slogan in such a high voice that Giriraj Singh, a firebrand Hindutva leader and a Union minister, can hear it.

 The incident has triggered a row, drawing a sharp reaction from the following which the Delhis Chief Electoral Officer sought a report from the returning officer of Rithala constituency over Thakurs speech.

1365,0,Hindi,pqr,"A last-gasp header from substitute Balwant Singh saw ATK pip NorthEast United 1-0 and go atop the Indian Super League table at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Monday.

 The hosts created plenty of chances but were wasteful until an injury-time strike from substitute Balwant proved to be the difference. Despite his absence from the touchline, Antonio Habas’ side returned to the top of the table, level on points with FC Goa who also have 27 points from 14 matches. The Highlanders remained on ninth position with 11 points from as many games.

 In-form ATK striker Roy Krishna had the NorthEast defence on red alert early on with his dangerous runs off the ball. After a couple of unsuccessful runs down the right flank, Prabir Das delivered an excellent cross in his third try and it almost found Krishna’s run into the box, until Kai Heering made a crucial interception to deny the Fijian a shot on target.

 The visitors had their first sight of the ATK goal minutes later. Having received the ball outside the box, midfielder Lalengmawia beat his marker, entered the box but sent his effort just wide.

 The tempo of the game slowed down after the early attempts at both ends. ATK looked more likely to open the scoring but couldn’t find a way past an organised NorthEast defence.

 Both goalkeepers were called into action just before the break. Edu Garcia slid a clever through-ball into the box for Krishna in the 39th minute. The ATK striker’s shot from a one-on-one situation was saved by Subhasish Roy Chowdhury with his feet. At the stroke of half-time, a Ninthoinganba Meetei cross met Martin Chaves whose header from inside the box forced a fingertip save from goalkeeper Arindam Bhattacharya.

 Robert Jarni hoped to gain a foothold in the game by bringing on Jose Leudo and Federico Gallego as the teams walked out for the second half, but the hosts continued to threaten. The influential Garcia once again sent a brilliant through-ball into the box, this time for Michael Soosairaj who ran in behind the defence and attempted to poke a finish into the net. With the keeper well beaten, Mislav Komorski’s goalline clearance kept the scoreline intact.

 Defender Pritam Kotal was next in line to be presented with another big chance to score in the 68th minute. A Javier Hernandez free-kick caused chaos inside the box and the ball looped towards Kotal whose strike flew over the bar.

 There were chances for both teams to settle the matter towards the end. Nikhil Kadam’s through ball almost sent Gallego through on goal but for Arindam’s quick intervention. At the other end, Mislav Komorski came up with two crucial interventions to deny Krishna and Prabir Das.

 Just when it looked like the teams would have to share the spoils, substitute Balwant Singh produced a match-winner in the last of the four added minutes. The striker, who came off the bench for Edu Garcia in the 90th minute and was left unmarked inside the box for a Hernandez corner-kick, headed the ball into the net to the delight of the home crowd.

 Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], Jan 28 (ANI): Bollywood actor and director Pooja Bhatt has said that she doesnt support the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and asserted that dissent is the greatest form of patriotism. My opinion of CAA and NRC is that I do not support it because it divides my house and whatever or anyone who divides my house I am going to stand up and protest against until my last breath, she said at a conference organised to demonstrate against the new law.The actor further lauded the student protesters and women at Shaheen Bagh and urged the leaders of the country to listen and have a dialogue with the protesters instead of demonising them.I think students have given us a message to wake up, get up and speak up because to speak with silence when we should protest is what makes cowards out of men and the time has come to raise our voices, said Bhatt.Please leaders wake up, listen to us, hear the women of Shaheen Bagh, hear the students, have a dialogue and dont demonise, stop demonising, she added.As a part of the conference, Bhatt and other members recited the preamble of the Indian Constitution to express solidarity with the anti-CAA protesters.Further invoking the Constitution of the country, Bhatt said, We read this Constitution, either you tear it or burn it permanently or dont teach this to our children in the schools because whatever you are teaching, your actions and words are not matching. This is the India I have grown up in and this is the India I will fight for. Id rather die on my feet or than live on my knees, she added.Bhatt ended the speech by thanking the present Government of India for unifying the country.I think dissent is the greatest form of patriotism. Isnt Hindustan our house? If we have some grievances from the government will it term us as anti-national or will it listen to us? I want to thank the ruling party that you have actually brought us together, said BhattThis solidarity was missing from the past five-six years, people were scared. Thank you to present Government of India for unifying us, the actor added.Pooja Bhatt and her father Mahesh Bhatt have earlier voiced their opinions about CAA and NRC with the latter one participating in demonstrations against the newly enacted law.

1370,0,Tamil ,xyz,"Kabul, Jan 28 (IANS) The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project has faced another delay in Afghanistan over a postponement in land acquisition, among other issues, according to local authorities.

 The Ministry of Mines and Petroleum said on Monday that some required letters have not been signed, TOLO News said in a report.

 And according to the Natural Resources Monitoring Network, construction on the project will be delayed for another six months.

 There is a need for the approval of the law (on land acquisition) but there are delays because the MPs are busy in (discussing) former decrees by the President. I think it will take six months to pass this phase, said Ibrahim Jafarai, a member of the Natural Resources Monitoring Network.

 Work on the $8 billion pipeline project began in Afghanistan in February 2018. At least 816 km of the total 1,814-km-long pipeline will pass through the provinces of Herat, Farah, Nimroz, Helmand and Kandahar in Afghanistan.

 The final destination of the pipeline will be the Indian town of Fazilka, near the border with Pakistan.

 When the projects agreement was signed in 2015, the work on Afghanistans part was scheduled for 2017, the TOLO News report said.

 Last year, the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum said work on the project will begin at the beginning of 2020.

 Meanwhile, critics have said that more government focus was required on projects like TAPI and should be prioritized, because of their major impact on the Afghanistans economy.

 Afghanistan is expected to earn more than $400 million in transit duties annually from the project.

 The country will annually receive 500 million cubic metres of gas from the project in the first 10 years.

 The amount will increase to one billion cubic meters of gas for the next 10 years and 1.5 billion cubic metres of gas in the third 10 years after the completion of the project.

1384,0,Gujarati,xyz,"Kobe Bryants aircraft crashed about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

 The pilot of the helicopter that crashed near Los Angeles, killing former NBA superstar Kobe Bryant and eight others, told air traffic controllers in his last radio message that he was climbing to avoid a cloud layer before plunging more than 1,000 feet (305 meters) into a hillside, an accident investigator said. Radar indicated the helicopter reached a height of 2,300 feet (701 meters) Sunday morning before descending, and the wreckage was found at 1,085 feet (331 meters), Jennifer Homendy of the National Transportation Safety Board said during a news conference Monday afternoon.

 NTSB investigators went to the crash site in Calabasas on Monday to collect evidence. “The debris field is pretty extensive,” Homendy said. “A piece of the tail is down the hill, she said. The fuselage is on the other side of that hill. And then the main rotor is about 100 yards (91 meters) beyond that.”

 Some experts suggested that the pilot might have gotten disoriented because of fog but Homendy said investigating teams would look at everything from the pilots history to the engines. “We look at man, machine and the environment,” she said. “And weather is just a small portion of that.”

 The pilot had asked for and received special clearance to fly in heavy fog just minutes before the crash and was flying at 1,400 feet (427 meters) when he went south and then west, Homendy said. The pilot then asked for air traffic controllers to provide ‘flight following’ radar assistance but was told the craft was too low for that assistance, Homendy said.

 About four minutes later, “the pilot advised they were climbing to avoid a cloud layer, she said. When ATC asked what the pilot planned to do, there was no reply. Radar data indicates the helicopter climbed to 2,300 feet (701 meters) and then began a left descending turn. Last radar contact was around 9:45 a.m. Two minutes later, someone on the ground called 911 to report the crash.

 Randy Waldman, a helicopter flight instructor who teaches at the nearby Van Nuys airport, said a disoriented pilot might have only moments to avoid a fatal dive. “If youre flying visually, if you get caught in a situation where you cant see out the windshield, the life expectancy of the pilot and the aircraft is maybe 10, 15 seconds, and it happens all the time, and its really a shame,” Waldman said.

 Some experts raised questions of whether the helicopter should have even been flying. The weather was so foggy that the Los Angeles Police Department and the county sheriffs department had grounded their own choppers.

 The Sikorsky S-76 killed the retired athlete along with his 13-year-old daughter Gianna and everyone else aboard and scattering debris over an area the size of a football field.

 Crews recovered three bodies on Sunday and resumed the effort on Monday amid an outpouring of grief and shock around the world over the loss of the basketball great who helped lead the Los Angeles Lakers to five NBA titles during his dazzling 20-year career. The pilot was identified as Ara Zobayan. He was the chief pilot for Island Express Helicopters, the aircrafts owner, the company said in a statement.

 “Ara has been with the company for over 10 years and has over 8,000 flight hours, the company said, adding that it was working closely with the NTSB to investigate the crash.

 Zobayan was commercially certified as a pilot and certified as a flight instructor, Homendy said. Several aviation experts said it is not uncommon for helicopter pilots to be given such permission, though some thought it unusual that it would be granted in airspace as busy as that over Los Angeles.

 But Kurt Deetz, who flew for Bryant dozens of times in the same chopper that went down, said permission is often granted in the area. It happened all the time in the winter months in LA, Deetz said. ‘You get fog.’

 The helicopter left Santa Ana in Orange County, south of Los Angeles, shortly after 9 a.m., heading north and then west. Bryant was believed to be headed for his youth sports academy in nearby Thousand Oaks, which was holding a basketball tournament Sunday in which Bryants daughter, known as Gigi, was competing. Air traffic controllers noted poor visibility around Burbank to the north and Van Nuys to the northwest. At one point, the controllers instructed the chopper to circle because of other planes in the area before proceeding.

 The aircraft crashed about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles. When it struck the ground, it was flying at about 184 mph (296 mph) and descending at a rate of more than 4,000 feet per minute, according to data from Flightradar24. Waldman said the same thing happened to John F. Kennedy Jr. when his plane dropped out of the sky near Marthas Vineyard, Massachusetts, in 1999.

 At the rally, Thakur, the minister of state for finance, shouted “desh ke gaddaron ko” to which the crowd responded “goli maro sa*** ko” (shoot down the traitors).

 Addressing the meeting in support of BJP candidate from Rithala, Manish Chaudhary, Thakur raised the pitch of nationalism as he linked opposition parties with anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh and with alleged anti-India slogans, and then asked the crowd to raise the controversial slogan.

 The controversial slogan has been raised by some junior BJP leaders of late, including Kapil Mishra, but this is the first time a party functionary of the level of a Union minister has participated in it.

 Thakur is also heard telling the crowd to raising the slogan in such a high voice that Giriraj Singh, a firebrand Hindutva leader and a Union minister, can hear it.

 Puttur: Two people who questioned the cruel manner in which cattle were being transported were attacked by the transporters – allegedly illegal cattle smugglers.

 The smugglers after brutally assaulting the two also damaged their pickup truck with stones and logs.

 This act of criminal brazenness occurred on the night of Sunday, January 26. Rupesh and Narnappa were in their pickup truck coming from Uppinanagady. At Kanchana they saw another pickup truck from Kolpe carrying cows. Rupesh, who was driving, followed the cattle truck, waylaid it and questioned those inside about the inhumanely stuffed cows.

 The cow smugglers, angered by the questioning, attacked both Roopesh and Narnappa and damaged their truck. They also tried to run their vehicle over both of them but escaped on seeing an approaching police vehicle.

 Both were later admitted to a hospital at Puttur. A case has been registered at the Uppinanagady police station.

 Management control would also be transferred to the successful bidder.

 Raju Kumar Mumbai  28 January 2020, 11:09:56 AM

 Global aviation consultancy firm CAPA has termed the governments decision to sell 100 per cent stake in Air India a bold reform and said it expects significant response from the prospective bidders.

 “The Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA) expects significant response (to Air India’s stake sale) as the offer structured by the government is attractive,” CAPA India chief Kapil Kaul told PTI on Monday.

 He said the time given for due diligence and submitting bids is also reasonable. The government on Monday announced sale of 100 per cent stake in debt-laden Air India as it issued the preliminary bid document for the strategic disinvestment and has set March 17, as the deadline for submitting expression of interest.

 As part of the strategic disinvestment, Air India would also sell 100 per cent stake in low-cost airline Air India Express and 50 per cent shareholding in joint venture AISATS, according to a bid document issued on Monday.

 The airline’s management control would also be transferred to the successful bidder. This is the second time in less than two years that the government has come out with proposal for selling stake in Air India, which has been in the red for long.

 The government has set March 17 as the deadline for submitting the expression of interest. AISATS is an equal joint venture between Air India and Singapore Airlines. It offers ground-handling services.

 “Clean exit by the government and entire non-aircraft-related debts taken out of AI (Air India) balance sheet, particularly as entire debt excluding aircraft is taken out and this signals a determined effort to exit Air India to allow taxpayers funds be utilised for social agenda of the government,” he said.

 Noting that this may be the single-biggest write-off by the government but for the right reasons, Kaul said, “CAPA see this as a very bold reform.”

Talking about how she landed up doing Jessies character in Malang, Elli says, I was overjoyed when Mohit sir called me to audition for Jessies part in the film. I wanted this film so badly that I nailed it in my first audition. He was happy with my audition and wanted me to look absolutely different and stand out in the film. For me, its a very tricky character to play.

 Spilling beans on how the team put together the look, she says, We tried several looks for the role, but when I put on this wig with the dreadlocks and it was a unanimous yes from the entire team. I dont think there has ever been a character like this attempted before in films. They wanted tattoos, but I requested Mohit sir to let me pick the tattoos myself. It gave me a better understanding of the world that shes coming from. I have never been to any rave parties and Jessie is somewhat a wild child. But, I have given this role my all.

1399,0,Tamil ,pqr,"Hamilton, Jan 28 (IANS) India leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal has termed M.S. Dhoni a legend and said that the entire team misses the former skipper. Dhoni has not played for India since the 2019 World Cup semi-final exit against New Zealand in the semi-finals.

 On Monday, as Team India hit the road from Auckland to Hamilton, Chahal revealed the spot where Dhoni used to sit in the team bus while traveling. In a Chahal TV video posted by BCCI, the host of the show, Chahal was seen talking about how much the team misses Dhoni.

 Shot inside the team bus on the way to Hamilton where Team India will on Wednesday take on New Zealand in the third T20I of the ongoing five-match series, the video shows Chahal sitting beside the empty corner seat at the back of the bus, and saying, Yeh woh seat hai jaha ek legend baitthe the. Mahi bhai (M.S. Dhoni). Abhi bhi yaha koi nahi baittha. Hum unhe bohot miss karte hai (A legend used to sit here. M.S. Dhoni. No one sits here now. We miss him a lot).

 With his funny side up, the leg-spinner asserted that Dhoni wanted to feature in the Chahal TV couple of times and even requested the spinner about the same.

 In the video, Chahal can be seen having funny conversations with Indian pacers Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh Pant, spinner Kuldeep Yadav and opener K.L. Rahul.

 Head coach Ravi Shastri has already revealed that Dhoni might still be considered for the T20 World Cup -- slated to be played in Australia later in the year -- if he performs well at the IPL which begins March 29.

 On January 16, Dhoni was omitted from the BCCI list of central contracts. However on the same day, the 38-year-old trained with the Jharkhand Ranji team.

1403,0,English,xyz,"Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], Jan 28 (ANI): Bollywood actor and director Pooja Bhatt has said that she doesnt support the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and asserted that dissent is the greatest form of patriotism. My opinion of CAA and NRC is that I do not support it because it divides my house and whatever or anyone who divides my house I am going to stand up and protest against until my last breath, she said at a conference organised to demonstrate against the new law.

 The actor further lauded the student protesters and women at Shaheen Bagh and urged the leaders of the country to listen and have a dialogue with the protesters instead of demonising them.

 I think students have given us a message to wake up, get up and speak up because to speak with silence when we should protest is what makes cowards out of men and the time has come to raise our voices, said Bhatt.

 Please leaders wake up, listen to us, hear the women of Shaheen Bagh, hear the students, have a dialogue and dont demonise, stop demonising, she added.

 As a part of the conference, Bhatt and other members recited the preamble of the Indian Constitution to express solidarity with the anti-CAA protesters.

 Further invoking the Constitution of the country, Bhatt said, We read this Constitution, either you tear it or burn it permanently or dont teach this to our children in the schools because whatever you are teaching, your actions and words are not matching.

 This is the India I have grown up in and this is the India I will fight for. Id rather die on my feet or than live on my knees, she added.

 Bhatt ended the speech by thanking the present Government of India for unifying the country.

 I think dissent is the greatest form of patriotism. Isnt Hindustan our house? If we have some grievances from the government will it term us as anti-national or will it listen to us? I want to thank the ruling party that you have actually brought us together, said Bhatt

 This solidarity was missing from the past five-six years, people were scared. Thank you to present Government of India for unifying us, the actor added.

 Earlier reports had indicated that the Taliban agreed to a short-term reduction in violence, but the sources said on Monday that the militant group has shared the new US demand with their leadership and that internal discussions were underway, TOLO News reported.

 The talks between the US and the Taliban were continuing, but with pauses, according to the sources.

 Echoing the sources, former Taliban member Maulana Jalaluddin Shinwari, said: “(US envoy Zalmay) Khalilzad has asked them (the Taliban) that there should be an agreement on a long-term reduction in violence.

 “The Taliban are consulting about this with their leaders. There are hopes that this will have a positive result.”

 The new developments come as a group of Afghan politicians announced a “National Reconciliation Plan”, which they say will form a structure to represent the country in intra-Afghan dialogue.

 Earlier this week, a group of political parties in a meeting said they were seeking a national consensus on peace, said the TOLO News report.

 They called on the government to join this national consensus in order to move forward peace negotiations with the Taliban.

 Earlier this month, the US and Taliban resumed the stalled negotiations, which President Donald Trump had called off in September 2019.

 The two sides have been holding closed-door parleys in the Qatari capital to finalize the peace deal and gradual withdrawal of the US and NATO forces which launched a war against terror in Afghanistan 18 years ago.

 While the US has been demanding a considerable drop in militant violence against the forces before signing a deal, the Taliban have been arguing that a longer and wider ceasefire with the security forces can only be part of the intra-Afghan negotiations over power-sharing at a later stage.

 The US has around 11,000 troops in Afghanistan and has been gradually withdrawing forces even though the two sides have not signed a deal yet.

 The Trump administration intends to draw down another 4,000 troops before they sign a peace pact with the Taliban.-IANS News

 The petrol now costs Rs 73.60 a litre in Delhi, Rs 79.21 a litre in Mumbai, Rs 76.22 a litre in Kolkata and Rs 76.44 a litre in Chennai after the price cut.

 Similarly, diesel costs Rs 66.58 a litre in Delhi, Rs 69.79 a litre in Mumbai, Rs 68.94 per litre in Kolkata and Rs 70.33 a litre in Chennai, according to the Indian Oil Corporation website.

 The rising number of coronavirus cases and lockdown of several cities in China have impacted crude demand in that country. China is the second largest consumer of crude oil.

 Petrol and diesel prices in India might fall further in the coming days as people are restricting their travel plans to China leading to decrease in demand.

 The retail prices of fuel are dependent on the international crude prices and the rupee-US dollar exchange rate as India imports almost 80 per cent of its crude requirements.

 Domestic petrol and diesel prices are reviewed by oil marketing companies on a daily basis. Price revisions are implemented at the fuel stations with effect from 6 a.m.-IANS News

 Sanjay Bhoosreddy, principal secretary, excise, said that the decision has been taken with a view to promote tourism in the state. The change in the excise policy, however, is restricted to only big cities.

 “We are now giving bars the option of serving liquor till 2 a.m. and to hotels up to 4 a.m., but on certain conditions. Firstly, the option is only open to bars located in metro cities like Lucknow, Agra, Moradabad, Kanpur etc, apart from Noida and Greater Noida. For all bars located in these areas, time can be extended up to 2 a.m. Three, four and five star hotels can open bars up to 4 a.m,” he said.

 With special permission of the district magistrate and additional fees, the hours of serving liquor under a temporary bar license can also be extended by one hour, from midnight to 1 a.m.

 According to the new excise policy, bars will have to pay an additional Rs 2.5 lakh in license fees for the time extension.

 The excise policy has also allowed for an increase in areas in which liquor can be served in hotels. Service time in bars was 12 a.m. earlier and could be extended till 1 a.m. on payment of additional fees. From the existing limit of five spots, areas for serving liquor can be added on the payment of Rs 50,000 for each additional point.

 The excise department will also be giving licenses for serving liquor available in special trains, cruises and airports with a special focus on foreign tourists, at such locations.

 While a train liquor license will cost Rs 10 lakh annually, it will be Rs 3 lakh for a cruise and Rs 5 lakh for airport bars.

 However, the Liquor Traders’ Association of UP is not very happy with the government’s refusal to allow them to open retail shops from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., against the current time of 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

 K.L. Maurya, secretary of the association, said, “The rules are not friendly for retail shops. There has been an increase in license fees but no increase in maximum retail price of liquor. Timings have also not been extended for retail shops even though hotels are being allowed to serve for longer.”

 The common people also feel that extension of hours of serving liquor would affect the law and order situation.

 “If liquor is served in trains and airports, who will be responsible for ensuring the law and order situation? All night bars are a good idea only when you have adequate police force on the roads,” said P.K. Misra, a retired government employee.-IANS News

 Sinha was in Lucknow on Monday and he attended the press conference of former union minister Yashwant Sinha who is leading a Gandhi Sandesh Yatra. The press conference was held at the Samajwadi Party headquarters and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav was also present there.

 Congress leaders in Lucknow are now demanding action against Shatrughan Sinha for his continuing affinity for the Samajwadi Party.

 Congress leader Acharya Pramod Krishnam tweeted, “Shatrughan Sinha is a star campaigner of the Congress but he campaigns for SP and wears khaki pants of the RSS.”

 Krishnam has been upset with the actor-turned-politician ever since the Lok Sabha elections when Krishnam was contesting the Lucknow Lok Sabha seat on the Congress ticket and Shatrughan Sinha was campaigning for his wife, Poonam Sinha, who was contesting on the SP ticket.

 Acharya Krishnam said that senior leaders like Santosh Singh and Satyadev Tripathi could be expelled without any reason but the actions of people like Shatrughan Sinha were being ignored by the party.

 Congress leader Zeeshan Haider also said that leaders whose loyalties lie with other parties should be shown the door.

 “Ever since he joined the Congress, he has not bothered to visit the party office or meet party leaders but he regularly goes to the Samajwadi Party office,” he said.

 Meanwhile, Shatrughan Sinha, when contacted, told IANS, “Yashwant Sinha is my friend and I have been a part of his Gandhi Sandesh Yatra. The programme which you are talking about was a non-political function. I feel the controversy is being unnecessarily generated by some vested interests.

 The health commission in central Hubei province, the epicentre of the epidemic, said 24 more people had died from the virus and 1,291 more people were infected, raising the total number of confirmed cases to more than 4,000 nationwide.

 The World Health Organisation on Monday admitted an error in its assessment of the global risk of a deadly virus in China, saying it was “high” and not “moderate”. The Geneva-based UN health agency said in a situation report published late Sunday that the risk was “very high in China, high at the regional level and high at the global level.”

 Considering the writ petition by the petitioners on Monday, the court has sought the views of Central and state

 governments on the matter.

 The petitioners, a business man and an IT professional had met each other in May 2018 and fallen in love.

 After being in a relationship for two months, they decided to get hitched.

 In September last year, they got married in a private ceremony.

 However, the religious authorities declined to solemnise the wedding and hence the couple decided to get their marriage registered under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, which does not recognise homosexual marriages.

 In their plea, the gay couple stated thatit was aggrieved by the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 whereby the law provided therein only permits a heterosexual (opposite sex) couple to get married and a homosexual couple like them is denied equal access to the institution of marriage.

 They claim that the impugned provisions of the Act violate their fundamental rights and are thus illegal and

 unconstitutional to that extent.

 Seeking declarations in this connection and to obtain the relief for getting married under the Act, the writ petition was being moved jointly by the petitioners, who submitted that they have suffered public humiliation after they disclosed their love for each other.

 But, greater is the insult and indignity the petitioners have suffered at the hands of law, which refuses to recognise their union, causing immense pain and agony to them, they said in the petition.

 Noting that the impugned provisions restrict the process of application, solemnisation and registration of marriages to heterosexual couples alone and exclude homosexual couples from its ambit, thepetitioners said it must be held unconstitutional and thus be struck or read down to that extent of illegality.

As of Tuesday, more than 4,000 people have been infected across China, the bulk of them in and around Wuhan. Some reports have stated the symptoms of the infections as runny nose, sore throat, headache, fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, especially for those with weak immune system. There are currently no vaccines available to protect people against the infection that can be transmitted from human to human.

 The deadly coronavirus has also affected people in Australia, Cambodia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, United States, France and Germany.

 China on Tuesday postponed the start of the spring semester for schools and universities across the country over concerns about a deadly virus outbreak. The decision came as the death toll from the new coronavirus soared to 106. Students are currently on holiday for the Lunar New Year and the education ministry did not provide a date for teaching to resume.

 In Britain, around 1,500 people who came to the country from the Chinese epicentre of the epidemic in the past two weeks must put themselves in isolation, the UK health minister said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said authorities cannot be 100 percent certain that the virus cannot spread from a person who exhibits no flu-like symptoms.

 Canadian health authorities also confirmed the countrys first case of a deadly coronavirus, and said the patients wife had also tested positive. The womans case is still listed as presumptive, pending final confirmation by a national lab in Winnipeg, officials said. Nearly 20 people are being monitored.

 The patient confirmed to have the virus — a man in his 50s who arrived in Toronto on January 22 from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic — is being treated in isolation in a hospital there. His wife, who traveled with him, also is believed to have contracted the virus and is in self-isolation, David Williams, Ontario provinces chief medical officer, said in a statement.

 The US State Department has encouraged Americans to reconsider any plans to travel to China. The State Department also issued a stern warning for its citizens not to travel to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. So far, 82 people have died as a result of the virus, all of them in China.

 Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has said it remained unclear if the deadly coronavirus spreading in China and beyond is contagious during its incubation period, before symptoms appear.

 The virus, which can cause a pneumonia-like acute respiratory infection, has in a matter of weeks killed more than 80 people and infected some 2,740 in China, while cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries. In a fresh report on the new virus, known as 2019nCoV, the UN health agency said current estimates put the incubation period for the virus at between two and 10 days.

 Global stocks and oil also dropped as panicked investors fled risky assets for safer bets gold, bonds, the dollar and the yen, after China warned that a deadly new coronavirus was spreading fast.

 SHARE, SAVE, COMMENT

 Federal investigators on Monday sifted through the wreckage of the helicopter crash that killed basketball legend Kobe Bryant and eight other people, hoping to find clues to what caused the accident that stunned the world.

 A five-time NBA champion for his only team, the LA Lakers, and a double Olympic gold medalist, Bryant was widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players in history.

 He was traveling on his private helicopter from Orange County, where he lived, to his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks where his daughter was set to play.

 Jennifer Homendy, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, told a press conference that investigators would remain at the site of the crash throughout the week to collect evidence.

 We will be here about five days on scene to collect perishable evidence, she said. We are not here to determine the cause of the accident. We will not determine that on scene. Homendy said the aircraft did not have a black box, which was not required on that type of helicopter.

 He added that given the number of people trying to access the site unlawfully, his agency has had to resort to police on horseback or all terrain vehicles to secure the area.

 Philippe Lesourd, a helicopter pilot and instructor who has been flying in California for 29 years, told AFP that the heavy fog likely caused the pilot to lose control of the aircraft.

 The fog was heavy enough on Sunday that the Los Angeles Police Department and the sheriffs office grounded their helicopters for part of the day.

 Witnesses told local media the helicopter appeared to be flying very low and seemed to struggle before it slammed into a hillside.

 Apart from Bryant and his daughter Gianna, the other passengers on the flight included baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife Keri and their daughter Alyssa, who played basketball at the same club as Gianna.

 Christina Mauser, an assistant coach of the Mamba girls basketball team, was also killed along with Sarah and Payton Chester, a mother and daughter.

 News of the crash reverberated across the globe and hundreds gathered at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, where Bryant wowed fans for 20 years, placing flowers, candles and messages for their fallen hero.

 Tributes have also flooded in from former US presidents, pop stars and athletes from different sports, a sign of how the man known as the Black Mamba had transcended basketball.

 The NBA announced that it had postponed Tuesdays Lakers game against the Los Angeles Clipper in the wake of the tragedy.

 The incident happened as Du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen were frustrating England during a 92-run partnership on a hot afternoon. The England players seemed to be getting annoyed at Du Plessis habit of picking up the ball after playing a defensive shot.

 After a throw from Sam Curran hit his pads, there were some heated words and Du Plessis appeared to walk into Buttler. Thats part of my character, said Du Plessis on Monday.

 If you go back youll find Im always involved in a little bit of something in a game, trying to show that fight as a leader of the team to show you dont stand back to opposition.

 Its not like Im looking for it but if it comes across my way I wont back down. So that was just him (Broad) saying something to me and me saying something back. I dont think either Jos or myself knew we touched each other, said Du Plessis, who is under pressure after a poor run of form.

 It was just myself and Broady having a go at each other at that stage and it was him trying to get between me and him. There was no malicious intent. England captain Joe Root said he thought the incident was absolute nothing and that at the time he was worried that it would make Du Plessis more determined.

 I thought Faf was using it to get himself going and my worry was that it was going to work in his favour, he said. It was absolute handbags.

 A miserable series for Du Plessis was completed after the close of play on Monday when South Africa were fined 60 percent of their match fee and deducted six World Test Championship points.

 When the pilot was asked of his plan, there was no reply.

 After climbing up, the chopper reportedly descended in a left turn before crashing into a mountainside with such a force that it left a crater. The impact split the helicopter into pieces, creating debris field stretching about 500-600 feet.

 Bryant was travelling in his private helicopter with 13-year-old daughter Gianna from his residence in Orange County to Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks.

 Jennifer Homendy, member of the National Transportation Safety Board, said they will be at the crash site this entire week to collect evidences. “It was a pretty devastating accident scene,” Homendy told reporters.  “We will be here about five days on scene to collect perishable evidence,” she said. “We are not here to determine the cause of the accident. We will not determine that on scene.”

 The poor visibility on Sunday morning had forced Los Angeles County Sheriff’s and Los Angeles Police departments to ground their choppers.

 Bryant retired from professional basketball in 2016, scoring 60 points in what turned out to be a dream farewell at the Staples Center. He is the fourth in the all-time point scoring NBA history.

 Apart from becoming an NBA legend, Bryant also won an Oscar for his short film “Dear Basketball” in 2018.

 He is survived by his wife Vanessa and three daughters.

 The Union Budget 2020 may allocate Rs 50,000 crore recapitalisation for the banks undergoing merger to support them through the amalgamation with the anchor banks.

 The merging banks will need support to pull through the merger and are in need of capital at least for three quarters in the next fiscal to meet their overall regulatory capital limits post merger and not to put pressure on the anchor banks balance sheet, a source said.

 The idea behind the budgetary provision for capital infusion is the merging banks could be in losses and their NPA situation may not dramatically improve and this may disturb the healthy capital base of the anchor banks.  Budget 2019 had allocated Rs 70,000 crore to the public sector banks to be infused to meet their core capital regulatory needs.  Currently, the Indian Overseas Bank, the Central Bank of India, the UCO Bank and the United Bank of India are under Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework due to their poor balance sheet and capital position. They also stand to gain from the recap, sources added.  As per the merger road map, the Punjab National Bank, the Oriental Bank of Commerce and the United Bank of India are to be merged. The new merged bank will be the second-largest PSB in the country with Rs 18 lakh crore business and the second-largest branch network in India.

1427,0,English,pqr,"Commercial air travel has become safer than ever, according to a study that tracked the continued decrease in passenger fatalities around the world.

 The study, published in the journal Transportation Science, found that between 2008 and 2017, airline passenger fatalities fell significantly compared to the previous decade.

 Globally, that rate is now one death per 7.9 million passenger boardings, compared to a death per 2.7 million boardings during the period 1998-2007, according to the researchers from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the US.

 They noted that the commercial airline fatality risk was one death per 750,000 boardings during 1978-1987.

 “The worldwide risk of being killed had been dropping by a factor of two every decade. Not only has that continued in the last decade, the improvement is closer to a factor of three,” said Arnold Barnett, an MIT scholar.

 “The pace of improvement has not slackened at all even as flying has gotten ever safer and further gains become harder to achieve. That is really quite impressive and is important for people to bear in mind,” Barnett said.

 The study also reveals that there is discernible regional variation in airline safety around the world.

 It found that the nations housing the lowest-risk airlines are the US, the members of the European Union, China, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Israel.

 The aggregate fatality risk among those nations was one death per 33.1 million passenger boardings during 2008-2017, the researchers said.

 For airlines in a second set of countries, with an intermediate risk level, the rate is one death per 7.4 million boardings during 2008-2017, they said.

 This group includes many countries in Asia as well as some countries in South America and the Middle East, according to the researchers.

 For a third and higher-risk set of developing countries, including some in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, the death risk during 2008-2017 was one per 1.2 million passenger boardings, they noted.

 This was an improvement from one death per 400,000 passenger boardings during 1998-2007, the researchers found.

 “The two most conspicuous changes compared to previous decades were sharp improvements in China and in Eastern Europe,” said Barnett.

 Overall, Barnett suggests, the rate of fatalities has declined far faster than public fears about flying.

 “Flying has gotten safer and safer. It’s a factor of 10 safer than it was 40 years ago, although I bet anxiety levels have not gone down that much. I think it’s good to have the facts,” Barnett said.

 He used data from the World Bank to measure the number of passengers carried, which is now roughly four billion per year.

 The research also includes historical data showing that even in today’s higher-risk areas for commerical aviation, the fatality rate is better than it was in the leading air-travel countries just a few decades in the past.

 “The risk now in the higher-risk countries is basically the risk we used to have 40-50 years ago” in the safest air-travel countries, Barnett noted.

 The upcoming Union Budget should come up with business-friendly policies for the gems and jewellery industry, according to Shailen Mehta, Co-founder of eJOHRI, an onmichannel jewellery startup.

 The e-commerce segment requires policies and regulations to benefit the overall jewellery industry along with the consumers, he added.

 We believe if the industry receives adequate support from the government in the upcoming budget with policies that are business-friendly for the sector, sentiments will change for the better. With online shopping increasing by the day, the government should come out with suitable policies in the e-commerce sector which would benefit the consumers and in turn the jewellery industry, Mehta said.  Noting that the gems and jewellery industry is one of the most evolving and thriving industries in India as well as one of the major contributors towards the economy, he also said that the the past year was not a good one for it with many losing their jobs due to the challenging times and insecurity prevailing in the sector.  On the companys plans for the year ahead, he said that the online platform would look to aggressively expand its operations.  eJOHRI has been able to have more than 20,000 products (on the platform) in the last six months. In the next six months we will grow this to 50,000 products, Mehta said.  He said that the the immediate strategy of the company is to get more jewellers on board and more strategic decisions may follow during Diwali this year.  Last month the Mumbai-based startup had announced that it raised $1 Mn funding led by London-based investor Rajesh Ranavat alongside other investors in a Pre-Series A round.

 : In the run up to the Union Budget on February 1, a survey by LocalCircles has found that 69 per cent of respondents want tax-free income to be increased to Rs 5 lakh.

 Since the Government announced the corporate tax rate cut in September this year, people are hoping that the Budget 2020 will bring some relief for the individual tax payers as well.

 Currently, for individuals under 60 years of age, there is zero tax up to annual income of Rs 2.5 lakhs. Citizens were asked how should the government change this going forward.  Sixty-nine per cent said this should be increased to Rs 5 lakh while 18 per cent said it should be increased to Rs 3 lakh. Seven per cent said it should be kept at Rs 2.5 lakh only and 4 per cent said it should be reduced to Rs 2 lakh instead.  According to the survey, citizens want the Government to not just provide a tax cut via Budget 2020 but also provide an incentive to spend the same. LocalCircles conducted a large survey and received more than 80,000 responses from across the country.  When asked what sector according to them should get top allocation in budget 2020, 30 per cent said environment (air, water, waste management etc.), 26 per cent said infrastructure, 16 per cent said agriculture, 8 per cent said rural development, 6 per cent said skilling, while 11 per cent said women and child safety.  Increasing consumer spending will be a key to bringing the economy back on track. To a question on what is the best way for the government to boost consumer spending via Budget 2020, 28 per cent said just a tax rate cut across the board would do the trick while 29 per cent said the Government should provide a tax cut across the board and incentivise the tax payer to spend it within a year.  Thirteen per cent said a domestic tourism deduction of upto Rs 50,000 per year should be provided, 10 per cent said a deduction of upto Rs 25,000 per year should be provided on school or professional education and a small 1 per cent said a deduction of Rs 50,000 should be given on purchase of an automobile. Sixteen per cent said the Government should look for other ways.  When asked how should the Government restructure the leave and travel allowance benefits currently available to employees, 24 per cent said it should be made available each year instead of every two years and 31 per cent said citizens should be permitted multiple trips within the prescribed LTA amount. Eighteen per cent said LTA should also include hotel stays while 13 per cent said LTA should not be restructured at all.  Fifty-three per cent in the following questions said standard deduction for salaried taxpayers should be increased to Rs 75,000 per year in Budget 2020. Nine per cent said it should be kept at the current Rs 50,000 per year and another 9 per cent said it should be increased to Rs 60,000 per year. Eighteen per cent said the government should do away with Standard Deduction and allow receipt-based deductions.  In 2015, the National Green Tribunal passed an order prohibiting 15-year-old petrol cars and 10-year-old diesel cars from plying on the roads to reduce pollution.  Citizens were asked how should the Government provide a subsidy to replace older cars (10-year old diesel and 15-year old petrol cars) with newer ones. Fifteen per cent said a flat subsidy of Rs 50,000 should be provided towards new car purchase, 34 per cent said a subsidy of 20 per cent of old car invoice price should be provided towards new car purchase and 7 per cent said subsidy of 10 per cent of old car invoice value should be provided towards new car purchase. Thirty-nine per cent said no subsidy should be provided at all.  When asked about the GST rate tier structure that should be effective from April 1, 2020, 48 per cent respondents said it should be a Three Rate Structure (Basic Essentials, All Others, Sin/Luxury Product) while 20 per cent said it should be a Two Rate Structure (All product and Sin/Luxury Products). Ten per cent said it should be a single rate structure.  Indian Railways has been cash strapped over the past couple of years and the decision to privatise some popular routes may come in as good news for the countrys largest employer.  The final question asked citizens what they wanted to be the top focus area for Railways in 2020. Forty-seven per cent said improving services and amenities, 21 per cent said improving safety, 15 per cent said improving timeliness and 13 per cent said improving cleanliness.

 Sixty-nine per cent said this should be increased to Rs 5 lakh while 18 per cent said it should be increased to Rs 3 lakh. Seven per cent said it should be kept at Rs 2.5 lakh only and 4 per cent said it should be reduced to Rs 2 lakh instead.

 : The National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) on Friday said that the upcoming budget should announce tax benefits and lower interest rates for people with disabilities.

 Among its recommendations for the upcoming Union Budget 2020-21, the organisation has also said the goods and services tax (GST) on products used by people with disabilities should be removed, and proper funds be allocated for implementation of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.

 It also said that people with disabilities should be given a 0.5 per cent benefit in interest similar to that given to senior citizens on account of the rising cost of living and increasing disability-related costs.  People with disabilities should not be denied health and life insurance, it added.  The procedure to avail customs duty relaxation or exemption on goods for persons with disabilities should be linked with a self-declaration to mitigate hardships caused in availing such exemptions and relaxations.  GST should be completely removed on goods used by persons with disabilities as it imposes high cost on products, the NCPEDP said in a statement.  Regarding income tax, the Centre recommended that the income tax ceiling for people with disabilities and those with dependents with disabilities be increased to Rs 5 lakh.  Increase in 80U exemption from 75,000 for people with less than 75 per cent disabilities and Rs 1,25,000 for people with over 75 per cent disabilities to Rs 1,50,000 and Rs 3,00,000 respectively. Increase in deduction on 80D from 50,000 per dependent to Rs 1,00,000 per dependent, the statement said.  The NCPEDP also suggested that a database of taxpayers availing 80U deductions be maintained which would throw light on the number of taxpayers with disabilities.  A deduction of up to Rs 40,000 is allowed for treatment of specified ailments such as thalassemia, the body said, adding that this should be increased to the actual expenses, or at least Rs 1 lakh, and the list must be updated to align with the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, while ailments such as multiple sclerosis should be also recognized for such exemptions.

1435,0,Hindi,xyz,"New Delhi: Three persons with a travel history to China have been kept under observation at an isolation ward of the RML Hospital here for a possible exposure to novel coronavirus, officials said on Tuesday.

 The three -- all men aged between 24 and 48 --  were admitted on Monday and their samples have been sent for testing to ICMR-NIV Pune laboratory, Dr Minakshi Bhardwaj, Medical Superintendent of RML Hospital, said.

 While two of the men are residents of Delhi, one hails from NCR.

 All the three patients have respiratory problems like cold and cough along with fever and they self-reported at the designated health facility to deal with such cases.

 According to Bhardwaj, two of the patients had returned from China about a week ago while the other about a month back.

 Till Monday, a total of 33,552 passengers arriving in India from China in 155 flights have been screened. As per data received on Jan 14, total 17 samples have been received by the ICMR-NIV Pune Lab, out of which 14 have been already been tested and found negative.

 Several people have been kept under observation in several states including Kerala, Kolkata and Maharashtra following screening for a possible exposure to respiratory virus, which has spread in China.

 The Centre has stepped up vigil in areas bordering Nepal in view of a confirmed case of nCoV detected there.

 The Prime Ministers Office on Saturday reviewed Indias preparedness to deal with any situation amid mounting global concerns over rising cases in China.

 A 24x7 NCDC Call Centre (+91-11-23978046) has been made operational to monitor the list of contacts furnished by the Ministry of External Affairs, provide details of district and state surveillance officers to those who seek them, and in case of any clinical query, direct the concerned to the relevant Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) officer.

 Thermal screening is being done at seven designated airports -- New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Kochi.

 Vardhan, who held a review meeting to analyse the preparedness for prevention and management of nCoV in India, also spoke to the Chief Minister of Uttarakhand on Saturday and assured him of all support for screening at the border with Nepal.

 The health ministry has urged passengers, who have a travel history to China since January 1, 2020, to come forward for self-reporting to the nearest health facility if they experience any symptoms such as fever, cough, respiratory distress, etc., and also inform the doctor treating them.

 On Saturday, the Union Health Ministry also issued a fresh advisory asking passengers to follow certain dos and donts if they are in China or if they are travelling or returning from China.

 The advisory stated that during their stay in China, if they feel sick and have fever and cough, then they should cover their mouth while coughing and sneezing, seek medical attention promptly and report to the Indian Embassy in China.

 The advisory also said that if they feel sick on flight, while travelling back to India from China, they should inform the airline crew about their illness, seek mask and self-reporting format from the airline crew, avoid close contact with family members or fellow travellers and follow other directions of crew and airport health officer.

 New Delhi, Jan 28: In a major order, the Supreme Court has granted bail to the convicts in the post Godhra riots case.

 The bail was granted in the Sardarpura post Godhra riots case in which 33 Muslims were burnt alive. The court put the convicts in two batches-one at Indore and the other at Jabalpur.

 The court directed them carry out spiritual and social work during bail. The appeals of the convicts are pending in the Supreme Court. The Gujarat High Court had acquitted 14 and convicted 17 in the case. The 17 were awarded life sentences by the High Court in the 2002 riots case.

 For Godhra Muslims, development is key poll issue; Past long buried

 The Supreme Court also directed the district legal authorities to ensure that the convicts carry out spiritual and social work. It directed the authorities to find them work for livelihood. Further the authorities were also directed to file a compliance report on the conduct of the convicts out on bail.

 In all, 76 accused were arrested in Sardarpur case by police, out of whom two died during pendency of trial, while one was a juvenile.

 The court had framed charges against 73 accused in June 2009 and initiated trial in the case.

 Besides the conviction of 31, the lower court had acquitted 42 others. The SIT later challenged in high court the acquittal of 31 persons out of these 42.

 However, the HC today upheld the Mehsana district court order acquitting 31 out of these 42.

 Meanwhile, the 17 were convicted by high court for murder, attempt to murder, rioting and other sections of IPC.

 The HC also upheld the decision of lower court to not accept the conspiracy theory put up by the prosecution, which had alleged that the attack on minority community was pre-planned and a conspiracy was hatched following the Godhra train burning incident.

 Thirty one persons were earlier awarded life sentence along with a fine of Rs 50,000 each in the verdict passed by special SIT court judge S C Srivastava while hearing the matter on November 9, 2011.

 2002 Godhra riots: SIT court awards life sentence to 2, acquits 3

 As many as 73 people were made accused in the case, in which 33 people of minority community were burnt to death at Sardarpura in Vijapur taluka of Mehsana district on the night of February 28, 2002, to avenge the Godhra train burning incident in which 59 people, mainly karsevaks, were burnt to death on February 27, 2002.

 This was one of the nine post-Godhra riot cases probed by Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team (SIT).

 A mob of hundreds of people had surrounded a lane, called Sheikh Vaas, in Sardarpura on the intervening night of February 28 and March 1, 2002, where minority population of the village used to live.

 The people of minority community took shelter in a pucca house of one Ibrahim Sheikh. However, the mob torched the house after pouring petrol on it, in which 33 people, including 22 women, were charred to death.

 Jodhpur, Jan 27: A pair of extremely rare conjoined twins were successfully separated after a total of 4 hours of surgery by the team of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) doctors in Jodhpur.

 The treatment of the children was free of cost as the family, coming from the lower strata of the society, was unable to pay for the same.

 Speaking to media, HOD, AIIMS Dr Arvind Sinha said,The twins were joined together at the chest and stomach. Both of them weighed close to three kilograms together, which brings the weight of each of them to around a kilo and a half. The ideal time for such operations is three to six months.

 After 50 hours of surgery, conjoined twins joined at skull, successfully separated

 One of the kids, however, had heart, lungs and kidney complications and his chances of survival were really low, he said.

 When such a situation arises, usually the life of the other child is also threatened. Therefore, we undertook the surgery, which went for over four hours and successfully separated the two on Sunday, he further said.

 Both the twins are on a ventilator and are under observation right now, according to the doctor.

To provide more such benefits to them, the State government is planning to give subsidies and land to farmers’ food processing units in Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporations (MIDCs).

 Maharashtra Skill Development Minister and Parbhani District Guardian Minister Nawab Malik revealed this during a training programme here.

 The minister recently reviewed the farmers’ training programmes being carried out under the Chhatrapati Rajaram Maharaj Udyojakata Va Kaushalya Vikas Abhiyan, which is a part of the Pradhan Mantri Kaushalya Vikas Yojana.

 Shares of Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) climbed as much as 3.17 per cent to Rs 2,471.70 apiece on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) during the early trade on Tuesday, a day after the company reported a 296 per cent rise in its standalone net profit for the quarter ended December 2019.

 On the BSE, the scrip rose 3.13 per cent to Rs 2,470.85 per share so far in the intraday trade.

 HDFC reported a 296 per cent rise in its standalone net profit at Rs 8,372 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2019, up from Rs 2,114 crore in the corresponding period year ago, aided by a value gain consequent to the merger of Gruh Finance, an associate, with Bandhan Bank.

 Gruh Finance (GRUH) merged with Bandhan Bank with effect from October 17, 2019. The corporation was allotted 15,93,63,149 shares aggregating 9.90 per cent of the total issued share capital of Bandhan Bank. “In accordance with ‘Ind AS 28 – Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures’ on derecognition of the investment in Gruh, the corporation has recognised a fair value gain of Rs 9,020 crore,” HDFC said.

 In terms of trade volumes, over 32.75 lakh shares were traded so far on the NSE while on BSE, over 0.94 lakh shares exchanged hands so far.

 “Given the headwinds facing the real estate sector, we believe HDFC Ltd remains best placed to leverage a) reduced competition in developer financing segment as ~35% of the market is either defocusing/recalibrating strategy/reeling under capital constraints, b) superior underwriting expertise and c) balance sheet strength to emerge as a primary beneficiary of the softening interest rate cycle and the impending revival in the real estate market,” JM Financial wrote in their post result report about the company.

 The brokerage has maintained a ‘BUY’ rating on the stock with a Target Price of Rs 2,710.

",HDFC shares rise over 3% following 296% jump in net profit,Hyderabad,Balwant Singh
1445,0,English,pqr,"By Hemal Mehta, Neha Rupani and Sagar Tirodka

 At a time the dark clouds of an economy struggling with record low GDP growth are looming over the country, India’s real estate sector is hoping for a silver lining when Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presents her second Union Budget on February 1, 2020.

 Here are some expectations of homebuyers from the Finance Minister:

 Rationalisation of interest rates on housing loans: High interest rates act as a deterrent to common homebuyers. In order to spur the demand for purchase, the government could consider rationalising interest rates to a level which is affordable to the common homebuyer.

 Tax benefit for owners of more homes: At present, income from house property for one self-occupied property is not chargeable to tax. Further, if a house property remains vacant as it could not be occupied due to reasons of employment or of business carried out at any other place, is also not charged tax. Any additional property is considered as deemed to be let–out (even if vacant) and tax is charged on the notional rent. The benefits of claiming nil rental income should be extended to additional vacant properties in order to encourage investment.

 Rollback of notional rent on unsold inventory: Tax is levied on notional rent on unsold inventory of developers after one year from the end of financial year in which completion certificate is received. Due to overall stagnation in the economy, developers are already struggling to offload their present inventory. This results in increasing the overall cost of developers, which in turn is passed on to the homebuyer.

 Enhancing the deduction from rental income: In order to encourage homebuyers and match with the increasing cost of borrowing and construction, allowing a higher threshold of standard deduction from the current 30 percent to say 40 or 50 percent will enable homebuyers to recover their cost to match the general inflation in the economy.

 Increase in interest deduction from income from house property: At present, interest deduction under the head income from house property is capped at Rs 2 lakh. The current interest rate for borrowings prevailing in the market may not match up to Rs 2 lakh of deduction. Further, carried forward loss under the head income from house property cannot be set-off against other heads of income. The cap on interest deduction should be increased to enable a homebuyer to claim deduction for the entire interest without any limit. Additionally, carried forward loss under the head income from house properties should be allowed to be set-off against all heads of income.

 Extension of interest subvention available for affordable housing to “low-cost housing or “compact housing”: Currently, additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh is available for interest on loan taken for affordable housing i.e. houses valued up to Rs 45 lakh. The same benefit should be extended to “low-cost housing” or “compact housing” for houses valued up to Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore in metro cities, and Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore in other areas.

 Legal support to the common homebuyer: The government recently amended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 introducing a threshold of minimum 100 or 10 percent of allottees in a project or class of investors required, who can approach the NCLT in order to start the liquidation process against a defaulting developer. The Budget should rationalise the minimum threshold and introduce measures to avoid genuine hardship to the single homebuyer.

 More than AIF needed: In November 2019, the government announced its plan to launch an alternative investment fund of Rs 25,000 crores for affordable and mid-sized housing to unlock the demand-supply mismatch. Real estate projects that meet laid down criteria will receive the funding, wherein one of the criteria is net worth positive projects. Projects which have the potential to be revived but have negative net worth, will not be able to access funding from AIF. The concerns of a homebuyer, who has advanced money to such developers, still needs to be addressed.

 Other factors such as input tax credit in GST, lowering cost of land acquisition, rationalisation of taxation on REITs, stamp duty, a relook at funding under PMAY scheme will pave the way for healthier demand, competitive pricing and encourage investments in the housing sector.

 Batting coach Vikram Rathour on Tuesday called the new generation of Indian cricketers “incredible” and said the team management has already identified the core of players for the T20 World Cup in October-November.

 Rathour was speaking ahead of the third T20I between India and New Zealand at Seddon Park on Wednesday, with the Men in Blue leading the five-match series 2-0.

 “Adjustments will keep going on till the last minute. But as far as I am concerned and the team management is concerned, we have the core. We know what our team is going to be. Unless there is a case of injury or really bad loss in form, I don’t see many changes happening,” said Rathour.

 With one eye on T20 World Cup in Australia, India have been on experimentation mode since the start of the home season in September last year, giving opportunities to host of a youngsters including Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Deepak Chahar and Shivam Dube.

 The T20 team has been doing really well in New Zealand and the young guns have contributed significantly to its success, leaving the batting coach hugely impressed.

 “This new generation of cricketers is incredible. I find it amazing actually that they turn up and they are at their best straightaway across different format, different grounds and different countries actually. The amount of time they took to get settled (here in NZ)) was outstanding actually,” he said. India won the twin matches in Auckland thanks to brilliant outings from KL Rahul and Iyer. The batting coach expressed satisfaction that the younger batsmen are stepping forward for the team’s cause.

 “The more opportunities that these guys get, they are showing that they are capable. They are showing that they are match-winners on their day. That will help the team, of course, but it will also help their confidence.

 “Having seen KL (Rahul) and Shreyas as young cricketers coming through, in my mind, I have absolutely no doubt that they are match-winners. They are getting their opportunities now and they are showing the world what they are capable of, that is great to see,” he said.

 Rathour feels Iyer’s mindset makes him a better player. “Apart from having those (batting) skills, I think the mind set is amazing. He (Iyer) believes he is a big player, and he is, without any doubt. He genuinely believes that he is a match-winner and he is here to stay. And that mind set I think helps him, that is the biggest advantage he has,” he said.

 When asked about the ability of current generation to learn from the IPL whilst maintaining percentage shots as big hits, Rathour said, “Big power-hitters and all, that time was there initially, people used to think T20 is more to do with power-hitting but it’s not the case anymore. Proper cricketing shots, you still get value for shots.”

 Talking about the adaptation needed from one format to another, the coach said: “Players play so much cricket these days, all three formats consistently, day-in, day-out, they are making these adjustments on their own. The game of cricket has changed with times. Even in Test cricket, big shots are common. I don’t think it is that big a difference.

 “It is more of a mind set thing and about game plan. As a coach, I don’t think we really need to tell them anything. They are doing it on their own. They are stronger, fitter than from our generation. You can see that they are hitting big sixes and without any effort, that way the game has changed.” The next three games at Hamilton, Wellington and Mt. Maunganui will be played at regular-sized grounds unlike Eden Park in Auckland. Rathour hinted that there won’t be many alterations to the team’s strategy, apart from the bowlers firming up new plans as per conditions on offer.

 “You look at the conditions and go. It (Seddon Park) is a bigger ground, it is a regular ground, but we are still looking to play normal cricket, good cricket. I don’t think it alters anything. Maybe for the bowlers with their lengths, but with the batters, doesn’t make any difference.

 “On bigger grounds (like in Australia), running between wickets will cover the game plan. A good game plan is about players who look at the situation, conditions and accordingly bat. If we play on bigger grounds, I am sure this team is capable of running twos and threes and adjust their game accordingly,” he said.

 Since his appointment as batting coach of the senior team, a part of Rathour’s brief has been to bring up the younger batsmen in the side. In that aspect, he expressed satisfaction in terms of how the younger generation is coming through via A-tours.

 “A-tour helps a lot. In case of any injuries, if you are looking for any replacements, we know players are here, just a city away. They can immediately come in and they are already acclimatized to the conditions. I think that’s a great idea and that’s working really well for our team.

 “The foreign pitches are getting more even and even. There is not that vast a difference now like it used to be earlier. And the amount of cricket these guys are playing, as a coach you can’t do anything about not having practice sessions but they are adjusting beautifully.

 “Nobody is cribbing, no one is complaining. You don’t see anyone talking about grass on the wicket, moisture, etc,” he added.

 Rationalisation of interest rates on housing loans: High interest rates act as a deterrent to common homebuyers. In order to spur the demand for purchase, the government could consider rationalising interest rates to a level which is affordable to the common homebuyer.

 Tax benefit for owners of more homes: At present, income from house property for one self-occupied property is not chargeable to tax. Further, if a house property remains vacant as it could not be occupied due to reasons of employment or of business carried out at any other place, is also not charged tax. Any additional property is considered as deemed to be let–out (even if vacant) and tax is charged on the notional rent. The benefits of claiming nil rental income should be extended to additional vacant properties in order to encourage investment.

 Rollback of notional rent on unsold inventory: Tax is levied on notional rent on unsold inventory of developers after one year from the end of financial year in which completion certificate is received. Due to overall stagnation in the economy, developers are already struggling to offload their present inventory. This results in increasing the overall cost of developers, which in turn is passed on to the homebuyer.

 Enhancing the deduction from rental income: In order to encourage homebuyers and match with the increasing cost of borrowing and construction, allowing a higher threshold of standard deduction from the current 30 percent to say 40 or 50 percent will enable homebuyers to recover their cost to match the general inflation in the economy.

 Increase in interest deduction from income from house property: At present, interest deduction under the head income from house property is capped at Rs 2 lakh. The current interest rate for borrowings prevailing in the market may not match up to Rs 2 lakh of deduction. Further, carried forward loss under the head income from house property cannot be set-off against other heads of income. The cap on interest deduction should be increased to enable a homebuyer to claim deduction for the entire interest without any limit. Additionally, carried forward loss under the head income from house properties should be allowed to be set-off against all heads of income.

 Extension of interest subvention available for affordable housing to “low-cost housing or “compact housing”: Currently, additional deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh is available for interest on loan taken for affordable housing i.e. houses valued up to Rs 45 lakh. The same benefit should be extended to “low-cost housing” or “compact housing” for houses valued up to Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore in metro cities, and Rs 75 lakh to Rs 1 crore in other areas.

 Legal support to the common homebuyer: The government recently amended the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code 2016 introducing a threshold of minimum 100 or 10 percent of allottees in a project or class of investors required, who can approach the NCLT in order to start the liquidation process against a defaulting developer. The Budget should rationalise the minimum threshold and introduce measures to avoid genuine hardship to the single homebuyer.

 More than AIF needed: In November 2019, the government announced its plan to launch an alternative investment fund of Rs 25,000 crores for affordable and mid-sized housing to unlock the demand-supply mismatch. Real estate projects that meet laid down criteria will receive the funding, wherein one of the criteria is net worth positive projects. Projects which have the potential to be revived but have negative net worth, will not be able to access funding from AIF. The concerns of a homebuyer, who has advanced money to such developers, still needs to be addressed.

 Other factors such as input tax credit in GST, lowering cost of land acquisition, rationalisation of taxation on REITs, stamp duty, a relook at funding under PMAY scheme will pave the way for healthier demand, competitive pricing and encourage investments in the housing sector.

1450,0,Gujarati,abc,"Sudha and her sister were the only people in their family who were illiterate. When the Shiksha+ instructor came to Sudha’s house to convince her to enroll in the adult literacy classes, her family, comprising her husband, father-in-law, brothers, and two kids, were very encouraging.

 Sudha runs a cosmetics shop with her elder sister. Before she attended the Shiksha+ classes, she felt that she was dependent on other people for everything. For example, every time a customer came to the shop, Sudha had to call someone from her house to come and help with the billing. This was obviously not very good for business.

 Shiksha aims to offer transformational education to children and adults who have never formally been to school. Using ICT, it’s a program that greatly enhances the learning experience. When she started coming to the Shiksha+ classes, Sudha was hesitant and slow to pick up things. However, her instructor slowly decoded the reading, writing, and arithmetic for her. She began picking up concepts very fast. A devoted pupil, she never missed even a day, worked hard at her studies and paid attention to her teachers. Soon she was able to write her name. She could now go to the bank and make deposits and withdrawals. She could read medicine labels to understand which ones had expired. And she could help her kids to some extent with their homework, checking deadlines and dates.

 Says the wise Sudha, ‘If you want to gain something, you have to put in the effort. I had my usual work to do – looking after the family, the children… my sister’s husband is sick, so I have that responsibility also. And there’s my shop to care for. I would wake up at 4 am so I could get an extra hour to study, and at night I would study from 10 to 11 pm. Whatever problems I had in my life, I wouldn’t let them interfere with or affect my studying. Whenever I found the smallest amount of time I would study.’ The community of learners supported and helped each other make sense of their lessons. Sudha’s family members also assisted her with any doubts or confusion she had about the learning matter.

 The change in Sudha after she became literate was profound. Now she is confident that anywhere she goes, she will be able to handle the situation and herself. She can handle her shop inventory, the accounts, and the billing. Sales are up.

 “I loved the classes! I felt good about myself, about the studying…and I liked it a lot when didi told us about the outside world,’ says Sudha. ‘I’m running my life and my business so well now. I feel the strength within myself and it feels great.”

 Sudha hopes to continue her studies, acquire more knowledge and always maintain her independence, which is the most precious thing to her. But most of all, she has a glimpse of how the outside world works.

 Noise pollution has been adversely impacting the quality of life of all sections of society, especially students preparing for exams. Neighbours blaring loud music or chatter pouring through your porous windows may distract your child from the task at hand.

 Furthermore, the impact of noise pollution on our physical and mental health and wellbeing is well documented. It not only creates distraction and contributes to cognitive abilities which are essential during exam preparation, but it also contributes to stress, hypertension, and sleep deprivation.

 What becomes essential in such situations is that we manage our own internal peace. Fortunately, there are few things that can help to mitigate the effects of noise pollution during examination time.

 Earplugs are the most common wearables that come to mind. But there are other options to explore. Silicone ear plugs with earmuffs also work well to cancel up to 60 per cent of outside noise. Today, blinkers are also available which limit one’s sense of sound and light, helping the person concentrate.

 Read| 5 practical tips for parents to help students during exams

 The best way to prevent external noise from disturbing your peace at home is through windows and doors with sound insulation features. It is the most effective long-term solution to regulate sound inside the house. Our regular doors and windows are not that effective against high pitch noise which is why you can even hear the whistle of the night watchman. Quality windows and doors from good brands can go a long way in keeping the unwanted noise out. Gaps around windows and doors are effectively plugged with silicone sealant. A robust locking system at multiple points ensures that casement windows and doors are tightly shut to cut out outside noise. Sound insulating windows include two layers wherein a protective layer is placed behind the actual window. A buffer zone emerges between the two layers which provide additional insulation.

 If you cannot go for installation of new windows and doors immediately, you can arrange the rooms to block external sound. You can cover thin windows with heavy curtains. Align heavy furniture such as bookcase towards the side of noisy neighbour. Plug the gaps in windows with newspapers. You can also place a few pillows against the wall to absorb the sound from the other side when on the bed.

 One can also use white or pink noise to block out external distracting noise. A random noise with same amplitude or intensity throughout the audible frequency range, white noise is used to block or mask other noise. Apart from reducing the effect of external noises, this background noise stimulation is known to aid cognitive functioning which promotes learning. In case white noise does not seem to be working, one may try a related noise called pink noise. With a mix of high and low frequencies, pink noise is known to improve memory. There are other types of noise including grey noise or brown noise which serve similar purpose. These types of noises can be found on the Internet and can be downloaded. Other forms of music such as classical, trance, or ambient music can also enhance competition.

 While meditation can block little or no noise, it is a very effective method of increasing focus. It also helps in bringing down stress levels and enhances concentration. It essentially helps people to train their minds, and therefore becomes an enabler for concentration and focus.

 | Pakistan, Peshawar |

 Pakistani authorities on Monday arrested the leader of a rights movement that has made allegations of human rights violations by the military during anti-terrorism operations, officials said. Supporters of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) led by Manzoor Pashteen threatened nationwide protests in response to his arrest.

 PTM’s unusually direct criticism of the powerful military has brought it into conflict with Pakistani authorities, who accuse PTM of being bankrolled by hostile neighbours Afghanistan and India. The PTM denies that allegation. The military and the government deny PTM’s allegations of human rights abuses.

 Pashteen was arrested by police from Peshawar in the early hours of Monday on a number of charges, including “sedition,” a senior police official of Pakistan’s northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa told Reuters. The arrest was criticised by Afghanistan.

 “While our region is suffering from atrocities caused by violent extremism and terrorism, governments in the region must support and encourage peaceful civilian movements for justice,” President Ashraf Ghani said on Twitter.

 In response, the Pakistan foreign office described Ghani’s tweet as unwarranted interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs. It said “such statements are not helpful to the promotion of good neighbourly relations … and urges the Afghan side to work together for the common objective of peace and stability in Afghanistan and the region.”

 Many of PTM’s supporters are ethnic Pashtuns who hail originally from the borderlands with Afghanistan, the focal point of a near-decade long insurgency by Islamist militants and subsequent anti-terrorism operations by Pakistan’s military, which displaced millions of people from the area.

 The group also had two members elected as lawmakers in Pakistan’s parliament in 2018 general elections, both of whom were arrested under anti-terrorism laws last year and detained for close to four months before being released on bail.

 One of the two lawmakers, Mohsin Dawar, told reporters on Monday that PTM and its supporters would demonstrate against Pashteen’s arrest. Pakistani authorities have previously attempted to bar protests by PTM and brought legal cases against people who have taken part in demonstrations.

 Previously, Gulalai Ismail, an active campaigner for PTM, fled Pakistan for exile in the United States because of what she termed threats against her and her family made by Pakistan’s security apparatus. Her father, a university professor who remained in Pakistan, was arrested on charges of “hate speech.” He was released on bail after being detained for a month.

1453,0,Tamil ,pqr,"The Washington Post came under fire Monday for its decision to suspend a reporter a day after she tweeted about the rape case against Kobe Bryant, only hours after the former basketball star and his daughter died with seven others in a helicopter crash.

 On Sunday afternoon, as the world was learning the news and initial details of Bryant’s death, the Post’s Felicia Sonmez tweeted a link to a Daily Beast story titled, “Kobe Bryant’s Disturbing Rape Case: The DNA Evidence, the Accuser’s Story, and the Half-Confession.”

 Shortly afterward, she tweeted that she had received “abuse and death threats” from “10,000 people, literally.” She added that “any public figure is worth remembering in their totality.”

 Her tweets were later deleted.

 According to the New York Times, Post executive editor Martin Baron emailed Sonmez shortly after her tweets and said, in part, “A real lack of judgment to tweet this. Please stop. You’re hurting this institution by doing this.”

 In a statement Monday, Post managing editor Tracy Grant said Sonmez’s tweets “displayed poor judgement that undermined the work of her colleagues,” and cited a violation of the Post newsroom’s social media policy.

 Bryant was accused of and charged with sexual assault in 2003, but the charge was dropped after the accuser refused to testify. He later settled a civil suit with the accuser.

 After news of Sonmez’s suspension broke, numerous outlets criticized the decision by the Post. That included fellow Post employees.

 Post media critic Erik Wemple called the suspension “misguided.”

 New York magazine Washington correspondent Olivia Nuzzi tweeted, “News organizations should protect their journalists, not acquiesce to the mob when it comes for them. The Washington Post not only failed Felicia Sonmez, but set a dangerous precedent.”

 The Washington Post Guild also defended Sonmez in a lengthy statement, in part stating: “Felicia received an onslaught of violent messages, including threats that contained her home address, in the wake of a tweet Sunday regarding Kobe Bryant. Instead of protecting and supporting a reporter in the face of abuse, The Post placed her on administrative leave while newsroom leaders review whether she violated the social media policy.

 “Felicia had to leave her home out of fear for her safety and has gotten insufficient guidance from the Post on how to protect herself.”

 Kabul: The Taliban claimed responsibility for the downing of a “special American aircraft” flying over Afghanistan on what it described as an intelligence mission, while the U.S. military said there was no indication the plane was hit by hostile fire.

 The crash happened on Monday in the Taliban-controlled Sado Khel area of the Deh Yak district in Ghazni province, the Taliban’s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said in a message via WhatsApp.

 “A special American aircraft which was flying over Afghanistan for an intelligence mission was tactically shot down by the Taliban,” Mujahed said. “All on board including high-ranking CIA officers were killed.”

 Hours after the Taliban statement, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan confirmed that a U.S. Bombardier E-11A plane had crashed.

 “While the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire,” Colonel Sonny Leggett said in a statement. “Taliban claims that additional aircraft have crashed are false.”

 “Appears we have lost an aircraft,” General David Goldfein, the U.S. Air Force chief of staff, told reporters in Washington. “We don’t know the status of the crew.”

 Earlier on Monday, Afghanistan’s Civil Aviation Authority provided some details.

 “The plane was apparently dispatched for military operations and it took off from Afghanistan territory,” said Ghulam Masoom Massumi, the director of air traffic management at the authority, by phone. “The military plane was not a cargo plane.” Massumi added.

 He gave no details of the size and make of plane or the number of people on board.

 Initially, Afghanistan’s second Vice President, Sarwar Danish, had said that a passenger plane owned by the country’s national carrier, Ariana Afghan Airlines, crashed in the Deh Yak district of Ghazni province. However Ariana denied reports one of its planes was involved and said it was operating as normal.

 The incident follows reports last week the U.S. and the Taliban were moving toward a peace deal that would see the eventual withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and an end to the 18-year long conflict.

 It’s the second time in recent months the two sides have appeared close to announcing an agreement. In September President Donald Trump abruptly called off talks in response to a suicide bombing in Kabul that killed an American soldier.

 The militant group controls or contests half of the country, more territory than any time since they were toppled in 2001. The U.S. currently has 13,000 of the 22,673 foreign troops in Afghanistan, down from a peak of 100,000 in 2011.

 Tokyo: Byte, a new video-sharing app released Friday to compete with ByteDance Inc.’s TikTok, has rocketed to the top of Apple Inc.’s U.S. App Store.

 Created by Dom Hofmann, Byte reboots the deprecated Vine video-sharing service, which he co-founded in the summer of 2012 and sold to Twitter Inc. later that year. The parent company failed to find a way to make the service profitable and eventually discontinued it in 2016. Despite its brief existence, Vine became a cultural touchpoint in the U.S., with many users embracing its six-second time limit as a creative challenge. It was where controversial YouTube star Logan Paul, whose channel now has more than 20 million subscribers, got his start.

 Byte “ended Friday as the No. 1 free iPhone app on the U.S. App Store and is still in the top spot,” said Randy Nelson of research firm Sensor Tower. Beside the U.S., Byte is also the top free iOS app in Canada and ranks in the top 10 in Australia, New Zealand, Norway and the U.K. On Android’s Play Store, Byte is sixth among free apps in the U.S.

 The new app was downloaded more than 780,000 times over the weekend, with three quarters of those installs coming from the U.S., Sensor Tower estimated on Monday.

 The timing of Byte’s release coincides with a moment of reckoning for TikTok and its Beijing-based parent company. ByteDance is looking to hire a chief executive officer for TikTok, which is under increasing scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers wary about the influence of Chinese companies on American consumers. TikTok’s runaway popularity has been deemed to create “national security risks,” according to a letter by Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton in the fall.

 Unlike ByteDance, which is the world’s highest-valued startup, and most other social media contenders, Byte is starting off small and its community guidelines make several references to the company’s modest budget. Still, the strong early response to Byte’s arrival — coming with little to no advance fanfare — suggests the community that Vine built up remains loyal to the particular six-second format. Some of the early popular videos on the platform are humorous proclamations of “Don’t post TikToks here.”

 Caruana ended the event with a whopping ten points out of a possible 13, a feat that was achieved by Garry Kasparov in 1999 and Magnus Carlsen in 2013.

 Carlsen often finishes in second place when he doesnt win, but trailing the winner by two points is something the Norwegian is not used to.

 Wesley SO of United States finished third scoring seven and a half points in all, a half point ahead of Daniil Dubov of Russia and surprise packet Jorden Van Foreest of Holland.

 In the challengers section, things worked out well for the Indian duo of Surya Shekhar Ganguly and Nihal Sarin as they both won their games for a good finish. Sarin defeated Rauf Mamedov of Azerbaijan in what was a clinical display while Ganguly crashed through the defences of Anton Smirnov of Australia.

 David Anton Guijarro of Spain won the Challengers on 8.5 points to qualify for the Masters section next year. Uzbek teenaged Grandmaster Nodirbek Abdusattarov finished second on tiebreak ahead of Pavel Eljanov of Ukraine and Erwin LAmi of Holland.

 The incident happened as Du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen were frustrating England during a 92-run partnership on a hot afternoon. The England players seemed to be getting annoyed at Du Plessis habit of picking up the ball after playing a defensive shot.

 After a throw from Sam Curran hit his pads, there were some heated words and Du Plessis appeared to walk into Buttler. Thats part of my character, said Du Plessis on Monday.

 If you go back youll find Im always involved in a little bit of something in a game, trying to show that fight as a leader of the team to show you dont stand back to opposition.

 Its not like Im looking for it but if it comes across my way I wont back down. So that was just him (Broad) saying something to me and me saying something back. I dont think either Jos or myself knew we touched each other, said Du Plessis, who is under pressure after a poor run of form.

 It was just myself and Broady having a go at each other at that stage and it was him trying to get between me and him. There was no malicious intent. England captain Joe Root said he thought the incident was absolute nothing and that at the time he was worried that it would make Du Plessis more determined.

 I thought Faf was using it to get himself going and my worry was that it was going to work in his favour, he said. It was absolute handbags.

 A miserable series for Du Plessis was completed after the close of play on Monday when South Africa were fined 60 percent of their match fee and deducted six World Test Championship points.

 Kolkata, January 28: Chelsea have been offered the chance to sign Spurs target Krzysztof Piatek if reports in Italy are to be believed.

 The Pole has become out of favour at AC Milan and has been linked with several clubs across Europe and in England as well.

 Spurs have been among the biggest suitors of the 24-year-old but Chelsea could potentially hijack their target.

 Spurs have lost their talisman Harry Kane to an injury that could keep him out for the rest of the season. And, Jose Mourinho is desperate to sign a new striker in January who could fill in for the England international. They even made a loan offer for the Polish international with an option to buy in the summer. However, it is believed that Milan are only interested in a permanent deal or a loan deal which includes an obligation to buy.

 Chelsea could capitalize on Spurs hesitation to sign Piatek and ideally it would be a better move for the striker himself. If he moves to Spurs, he could potentially become their first-choice striker for the remainder of the season but things will change when Kane returns from injury.

 On the other hand, Piatek might join Chelsea as a back-up of Tammy Abraham, but it is yet to be seen if the 22-year-old Englishman manages to maintain his form or not. Replacing Abraham is any day a less difficult job than to replace someone like Kane.

 Piatek has certainly struggled this season, but hardly any Milan player has been able to impress. The Rossoneri have endured yet another difficult campaign and it would be not fair to single out an individual player for that.

 Milan reportedly want £25m for the services of Piatek and Chelsea are in a much better position compared to Spurs to take a shot with the striker.

1463,0,English,pqr,"Kenin moved through to a maiden grand slam semi via Tuesdays 6-4 6-4 victory over unseeded Tunisian Jabeur on Rod Laver Arena.

 Next up for American 14th seed Kenin is world number one Ash Barty, who defeated last years Australian Open runner-up Petra Kvitova.

 Both unheralded women were featuring in their first grand slam quarter-final after dazzling at Melbourne Park.

 Kenin upstaged 15-year-old sensation and fellow American Coco Gauff in the fourth round, while Jabeur became the first Arab woman through to the quarters of a major after beating giant-slaying seed Wang Qiang.

 The first set saw contrasting approaches – the variety on Jabeurs racquet resulting in 18 unforced errors and 17 winners compared to Kenins five unforced errors and eight winners.

 Kenin and Jabeur both had break point chances, but a break of serve in the seventh game saw the former move ahead 4-3 and it was a lead that she never relinquished.

 Jabeur saved five set points, however, Kenin – who had won the previous two meetings between the pair – eventually closed it out after 44 minutes thanks to another unforced error from her opponent.

 Kenin took control after a tricky start to the second set, Jabeur unable to maintain her fierce performance on centre court.

 Just like the first set, Kenin – yet to face a seed in Melbourne – broke in the seventh game and never looked back en route to the final four.

1464,0,Hindi,pqr,"In a rematch of last years quarter-final won comfortably by Kvitova, Barty secured a 7-6 (8-6) 6-2 victory on Rod Laver Arena on Tuesday (January 28).

 The world number one became the first Australian woman to reach the last four at the tournament since Wendy Turnbull in 1984.

 Barty, last years French Open champion, will face American 14th seed Sofia Kenin in the last four.

 The players traded breaks to love early before Barty fought out a tough hold after a 20-point seventh game.

 Last years runner-up Kvitova targeted Bartys second serve with plenty of success, but while four consecutive games went to deuce, both held serve through to a tie-break.

 A 69-minute first set went Bartys way, winning the last three points of the tie-break – which was highlighted by a 22-shot point during which the Australian showcased her defensive abilities – thanks to Kvitova errors.

 Barty broke in the opening game of the second set and again in the third, producing a delicate lob to take a 3-0 lead.

 A desperate and aggressive Kvitova pulled one break back in the sixth game, but handed it straight back in the next with a double fault.

 Barty managed to close it out in the next game, an ace out wide seeing her complete the job.

1467,0,Telugu,xyz,"A gay couple has moved the Kerala High Court, seeking to strike down certain provisions under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, which do not permit to get their marriage registered.

 Considering the writ petition by the petitioners on Monday, the court has sought the views of Central and state governments on the matter.

 The petitioners, a business man and an IT professional had met each other in May 2018 and fallen in love.

 After being in a relationship for two months, they decided to get hitched.

 In September last year, they got married in a private ceremony.

 However, the religious authorities declined to solemnise the wedding and hence the couple decided to get their marriage registered under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, which does not recognise homosexual marriages.

 In their plea, the gay couple stated thatit was aggrieved by the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 whereby the law provided therein only permits a heterosexual (opposite sex) couple to get married and a homosexual couple like them is denied equal access to the institution of marriage.

 They claim that the impugned provisions of the Act violate their fundamental rights and are thus “illegal and unconstitutional” to that extent.

 Seeking declarations in this connection and to obtain the relief for getting married under the Act, the writ petition was being moved jointly by the petitioners, who submitted that they have suffered public humiliation after they disclosed their love for each other.

 But, greater is the insult and indignity the petitioners have suffered at the hands of law, which refuses to recognise their union, causing immense pain and agony to them, they said in the petition.

1468,0,Hindi,pqr,"Netflix just dropped the first full-length trailer of Ghost In The Shell: SAC_2045. The streaming giant is bringing back the classic anime series with a whole new look. Ghost in the Shell, successful anime, game and film franchise just got a 3D animation glow-up. The trailer reveals the main characters of the series Major and Batou. Trust me when I say, you aren’t prepared for the drastic change in the visual narrative of the 90s Japanese series.

 Ghost In The Shell: SAC_2045 trailer looks like something that would happen to an anime if it tried a crossover with of Disney’s Pixar films. The 3D animation gives it a cartoonish look that isn’t familiar territory at all. I would get down to complaining had the trailer not looked so good. Yes, Major Kusanagi looks like teen Kusanagi now but will you look at the stunning CGI? You’ll get used to the character designs just as soon as the 1.36-minute clip gets to the action parts, which is immediate!

 The new Ghost in the Shell trailer set in 2045 is packed with action taking us through the exploits of Section 9, a counter-cyberterrorist organisation. In the anime and the previous films, GITS follows Major Mokoto Kusanagi, a cop who works with Public Security Section 9 solving crimes and kicking ass! The action scenes are nicely done with guns, explosions, enough fire-power you get you hooked. When 3D animation did a trial run, it wasn’t a very popular option. Not many anime fans were willing to give, say, Ultraman, a chance. But from the looks of this trailer, I don’t see much reason to complain. Some might still find the style a little difficult to relate with considering the anime’s core plot is deeply philosophical making it a title for mature audiences, decidedly not for children (the Pixar watching audience).

 When Netflix isn’t adding classic anime to its extensive catalogue, it’s producing its own version of anime shows. Just recently they announced The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf anime film while Cowboy Bebop’s live-action film is in the works.

 Ghost In The Shell: SAC_2045 is all set to release in April.

1469,0,English,pqr,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi is considered to be the saviour of India by many. Why? Simply because he claims to be. Last year, in a speech at the inaugural session of 100 years of Assocham (Associate Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India), he said that five-six years ago our countrys economy was heading towards disaster. And it is his government that has not only stabilised it, but disciplined it. Well, I think he and his believers should pay heed to what Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee is saying.

 Last year, Banerjee, along with Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer, won the Nobel Prize for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty. The man has a B.S. degree in economics from Presidency College, Calcultta, M.A in economics from JNU, a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University and is currently the Ford Foundation International Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. So, I dont know about you but I would be worried if he is saying something like Indias economy is in the gutter. And according to Financial Express he has said that,

 What I can say is that we could be in a recession. But, I don’t know by how much. There is nothing in the data that suggests we could not be in a recession. Given the current state of inequality in India, a wealth tax is completely sensible. In such a case, more redistribution is required, and I expect this not to happen soon.

 While talking about the banking and infrastructure sectors, Banerjee said,

 The banking sector is in doldrums. It needs huge funding by the government. The Centre should also look at infrastructure sector funding.

 While favouring the central governments decision to privatise PSUs like Air India, the economist said,

 The statistical apparatus is incapable of capturing short-term data on the informal sector.

 However, while talking about the recent cut in corporate taxes by the government, he said,

 It seems the corporate sector is sitting on huge cash.

 Well, the last part is undeniably true because, according to Business Today, a study conducted by Oxfam showed that income equality in India has gotten worse. The countrys top 1% has bagged around 73% of the countrys wealth. So, whats the solution? As reported by The Telegraph, this is what Banerjee said,

 Given the kind of inequality we have, a wealth tax is completely sensible. In general, more redistribution makes perfect sense to me. Do I expect it to happen right now? I suspect not.

 I am pretty sure that these pretty informed digs on the economical status of India is going to garner Banerjee a lot of negative attention from the ruling party and their trolls, who are simply incapable of taking constructive criticism. However, I hope that you, the sensible voting Indian, and Banerjee arent distracted by the commotion and keep working towards changing these odds, which BTW the government has no intention of improving. They will keep saying everything is alright and say stuff like putting Goddess Laxmi on the Indian currency is going to improve the economy. But yall dont lose your focus. Please.

1472,0,Gujarati,abc,"With the lack of interest from cricket fans, ICC decided to introduce a Test championship to regain people’s interest into the Test cricket. This idea of Test Championship will help bring the spectators to the stadiums especially in the subcontinent.

 In Australia, England, New Zealand and South Africa already have a large number of spectators coming to watch the Test matches but in Asia, this trend is other way around. So we are hoping that the Test championship will have a great impact on the Test cricket format.

 ICC takes almost ten years to start a test championship. The first idea of this championship was proposed in 2010, but due to some reason ICC disapproved of it. After that one suggestion came to start test championship between 2013 and 2017 but again this proposal was rejected by ICC.

 Finally, in 2019 ICC started a Test Championship from 1 August 2019 to June 2021. ICC allotted a two-year window for this championship in which every team will play three home and three away series. In this championship, only the top 9 test playing nations will take part.

 A series, which will consist of a minimum of two test matches will be considered as a part of this championship. Matches that will be played against other than these 9 test playing nations will not be considered as a part of this championship. Teams that will play Test matches other than this championship will be a part of ICC FTP (Future Tour Program).

 Every team will play a series of a different number of test matches but they will play the same number of series. Test Championship started on 1st August 2019 from the first Ashes test and the end of this championship will be upon the final played at the Lord’s between the top two teams.

 How teams will get points?

 Each series(either of 2,3,4 or 5 test matches) consists of 120 points in which if a team wins a match will get points by dividing 120 over the number of matches in that series. Similarly, if a match is drawn one-third (of winning a match) the number of points will be awarded to each team.

 For tie one-half (of winning a match) the number of points will be awarded to each team. No points will be deducted from the team which lost the match. So in this way, every match has equal importance. If in a series of three test matches one team won the first two test matches and get the unassailable lead, even then the third match will not be a dead rubber because of its points.

 One more thing about the points is, if a team has a slow over-rate then two points will be deducted for every over which is above allotted time.

 The complete distribution of points is in the table given below.

 The Final of this championship will be played at Lord’s from 10-14 June 2021. If two teams having equal points then the team that won more series shall be ranked higher. If teams are still equal, then the team with the higher runs per wicket ratio shall be ranked higher. The runs per wicket ratio are calculated by dividing runs scored per wicket loss over runs conceded per wicket taken.

 Tata Motors is all set to launch their all-new Nexon EV in the Indian market. The Tata Nexon EV is the first pure-electric compact-SUV offering from the brand and will rival the likes of the MG ZS EV and the Hyundai Kona EV for now.

 The Tata Nexon EV comes with a 95kW electric motor, paired with a 30.2kWh lithium-ion battery pack. The electric powertrain on the Nexon EV produces 129bhp and 245Nm of torque and claims a maximum range of 312km on a single charge (ARAI-certified).

 The Tata Nexon comes with a host of features and is based on the facelift-version of the conventional-powered Nexon SUV. This translates to a number of design changes, additional features and a host of safety equipment as well. We recently drove the Tata Nexon EV — here is our detailed review.

 MG Motor India has released an official statement regarding the MG Hector that caught fire last week. The brand clarified a few details about the incident after conducting a thorough investigation.

 According to MG, the fire was caused by the presence of foreign material in the engine bay that caught fire due to high temperatures. It was only last week that a video of an MG Hector on fire went viral. The video was watched by tens of thousands and a few hundred people shared the video.

 Some people immediately resorted to mudslinging and accused MG of producing a low-quality vehicle. Some others exercised restraint and decided to wait for an official investigation. Well, MG Motor India claims to have conducted not one, but two investigations.

 A statement put out by MG quotes the brand as saying, We immediately started two sets of investigations. One team comprised of our internal team of expert engineers especially trained on such issues at MG Motor. At the same time, we contacted an independent external agency under Government to investigate the details and determine the root cause.

 The teams undertaking the investigation came to the same conclusion, and MG Motor India has now made the same clear. The teams found the internal wiring, electrical connections and oil and fuel lines to be intact at the time when the fire erupted.

 According to MG, the fire was started by a foreign object in the engine area. The object - now purported to be a piece of cloth that might have been used to clean the car - was found in a charred condition near the high temperature zone, which is near the exhaust manifold.

 The heat in the area might have set the cloth on fire, which then spread to the other parts under the bonnet, eventually engulfing the entire front-end, as seen in the video. MGs statement on the matter also made it clear that the owner of the car that caught fire is satisfied with the way the company has dealt with the situation and investigated the fire.

 Thoughts On MG Motor Indias Statement Regarding The Hector That Caught Fire

 MG Motor India has acted responsibly in the matter by investigating the incident thoroughly. Though the owner of the car may be satisfied with MGs response, this entire incident once again emphasizes the need for proper maintenance. Proper maintenance of a vehicle is not just getting the car serviced on time. It is also about looking carefully at things that could be dangerous.

1477,0,Telugu,pqr,"Lets put a potentially large worry to rest right away, the Aura compact sedan will not be your next Uber or Ola ride. Hyundai is taking care of that market with the Xcent, which will continue to be sold alongside the Aura, but only for fleet operators.

 Sort of like what Hyundais doing with the Grand i10, which is positioned lower than its replacement, the Grand i10 Nios. A hatchback which is (almost exactly) what the Aura is, if you take its sizable 402-litre boot away. Well that, and the 1-litre turbocharged petrol engine thats now being offered in the Aura. Its the same cracker of a motor thats in the Venue but with tweaked power figures, and apart from the Tigor JTP, is the only turbo petrol in a compact sedan. Also available are 1.2-litre petrol and diesel engines, both being BSVI-compliant and available with AMTs as well. And with Maruti-Suzuki, Toyota and Tata shying away from small capacity diesels for now, Hyundai definitely has a market open. Lets dive into what else sets the Aura apart.

 Though it shares much with the Grand i10 Nios, the Aura has a different two-part grille that extends into the lower bumper, apart from a different bumper itself, with slightly larger apertures for the fog lamp cutouts. Metal work is shared all the way to the rear door, where like in the Nios, theres a blacked out C-pillar in gloss black shrouding. Unfortunately, the kink in the shoulder line here, that works so well in the Nios, looks out of place on the Aura, which sees that line then end a little abruptly in a relatively high boot deck.

 The deck lid itself has a little bit of an upturned edge, like the Xcent before it, but the tail lights could be seen as a little too fussy and large. In isolation, design features like the deep reflector cutouts in the rear bumper, gloss black trim across the boot lid, and JDM-style tail lights are quite bold, but put together, the Aura doesnt feel like a cohesive design. While other colours get a satin silver grille outline, the red, silver and white come with a Turbo Pack that nets you a gloss-black grille, which is far sportier looking. With the only cue to the Turbo being the solitary badge on the front, we wonder why Hyundai didnt take the chance to give the 1-litre turbo added cred in the form of a full chrome-delete, sportier looking wheels and wider/better rubber. As such, the Aura comes with 175/60 R15 MRF ZVTV EcoTred rubber, on unique looking polished alloy wheels.

 Its nothing you havent seen on the Nios before, which means the same thoughtfully laid out and neat cabin, but in new colour combinations. Non-turbo variants get grey and beige interiors, while the 1-litre gets a sporty grey, black and red theme. And while quality of plastics in key touch areas is above average for the class, the all-plastic door pads dont feel the greatest, especially at the rear. Were used to seeing it on the Xcent, it was acceptable on the Nios but really, some fabric couldve made a world of difference. A strange omission, really, seeing how high quality the fabric upholstery feels in the Aura.

 As is the case with new Hyundais, the Aura scores high on the equipment front, with a large and easy-to-use 8-inch touchscreen with smartphone integration, and bundled with Arkamys audio, which can be set to display the reversing camera imagery even on the go. Also on the list are wireless charging, rear AC vents, two airbags, ABS with EBD, ISOFIX points and more. Curiously, automatic wipers and headlights are missing.

 Seating remains as comfortable front and rear, with good levels of space in the rear thanks to the 25mm increase in wheelbase over the Xcent. Though, like in the Nios, three adults seated abreast will still find themselves rubbing shoulders. The main advantage of adding that boot, however, is seen in the huge 402-litres of boot space. Larger than the Dzires 378-litres, the boot also appears quite wide and tall, even if the loading aperture is narrow.

 Being the newest motor to the lineup, the 1-litre turbo petrol is our focus. With 998cc of displacement and three-cylinders making 100PS and 175Nm torque, its a great performer for what feels like a light car, though Hyundai hasnt officially released the kerb weight figures. Compared to the Venues motor which makes 120PS and comes with a six-speed, the Aura Turbo is only available with a 5-speed manual gearbox. Despite which, its earned a 20.5kmpl ARAI-certified fuel efficiency figure.

 Quiet at startup, the 1-litre turbo wakes up post 1,600rpm or so and pulls very enthusiastically (with the slightest hint of torque steer) through the revs all the way to its 6,500rpm redline, though you can feel it start to strain a bit post 5,000 revs. The tall gearing means that the Aura doesnt ask for a change in gear as frequently as some of the competition, especially in city driving, where it feels utterly calm in third at about 60kmph. Shifts are typical Hyundai smooth, and a light clutch action helps. Out on the highway, at 100kmph the motors just under 2,100rpm, and is still quite relaxed at about 2,500rpm at 120kmph. Will a sixth gear have helped? Were not entirely sure its necessary, but it definitely wouldve given the Aura Turbo a more premium feel.

 Further, the Aura feels as stiffly setup as the Grand i10 Nios, itself a firm-riding car. The suspension has been retuned to offset the added weight, but one cant help but feel that something in the equation hasnt been balanced quite right. While it doesnt crash into potholes, the Aura does make sure you feel the road youre travelling over. And the flipside isnt great high speed stability, with the slightly soft-feeling from the rear becoming more pronounced as the speeds rise, particularly around the 115-120kmph mark. This means bumps, dips and crests taken under 100kmph feel okay, but can induce a slight bobbing at speeds higher than that.

 As for handling, on this enthusiast-oriented Turbo, we just wish Hyundai could offer better rubber on it. You can almost make up for the light steering that doesnt want to weigh up a whole lot in corners, because the Nios does like being thrown into a turn, showing a tendency to want to rotate and turn easily, but the rubber just leads to understeer. Wider rubber should also help the feel from the steering, so thats worth considering. Not to mention that itll help the Aura track true under braking, where it currently feels quite light at the rear and requires a slight correction under heavy braking to stay in its lane.

 Is the Aura a much better car than the Xcent? Of course it is, with a more chic cabin and far more features. Is the Turbo the compact sedan for the enthusiast? That were not so sure about, mainly down to the feel from the steering, or rather the lack of it. At an ex-showroom price of Rs 8.55 lakh, what you get then is a spacious compact sedan that can excite far more than anything else in the market, if you drive it within reason. As for the throwing reason to the wind, its got a Turbo badge on the front, doesnt it?

McIntyre was the one to eliminate Lesnar after the latter had dominated the early part of the Rumble – coming in at the No,2 spot – eliminating 13 superstars in a row – tying with most eliminations at the Rumble with Braun Strowman, who also had 13 eliminations at the WWE Greatest Royal Rumble in 2018.

 In the main event segment, Edge made an emotional comeback to WWE Raw after announcing retirement nine years back, saying he has the grit to take to the squared circle once again and he is gonna give it a go the second time around till his body allows him.

 But, Randy Orton interfered segment and teased a reunion of Rated RKO, before hitting the patented cutter on Edge and then proceeded to hit Edge with stell chairs. He then placed a steel chair on the neck of Edge (neck injury had forced Edge to retire), and took to the top rope, but contemplated his next, to build the tension, However, he climbed down, took two more chairs and proceeded to hit Edge on the head before leaving his former tag partner lying in shock.

1480,0,Tamil ,xyz,"Union Minister and BJP leader Giriraj Singh took a jibe at Delhis Shaheen Bagh protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) after Zee News Editor-In-Chief Sudhir Chaudhary was stopped by agitators and not allowed to cover the agitation. The incident took place on Monday when a certain section of media was not allowed to cover the ongoing protest and the protesters, most of them women, did not allow the Zee News Editor-In-Chief to cross the police barricade.

 Reacting over this incident, Singh took to the micro-blogging site, Twitter, drawing similarities between the protest site and the Attari-Wagah border between India and Pakistan. Singh retweeted a video by Chaudhary highlighting how he was stopped and not allowed to cross the barricades at the protest site.

 Live TV

 The BJP leader stated that after watching the video it seemed that Chaudhary was standing on the Attari-Wagah border, where the Zee News Editor-In-Chief was in India with the no mans land next to him. Singh questioned the place of the protesters hinting that they were on the other side of the border. He also said that the visa for Shaheen Bagh is given by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.

 Hume toh lagraha hai aap Attari-Wagah Border par khade hai...Aap Hindustan mein....beech mein no mans land...aur us taraf.....? Shaheen Bagh ka visa Kejriwal aur Manish Sisodia dete hai. (I feel that you are standing on the Attari-Wagah Border..you in India... no mans land in the middle ... and on that side .....? Shaheen Baghs visa is given by Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia.), tweeted Singh.

 After reaching the protest site, Sudhir Chaudhary kept on urging the protesters to allow him to meet them and bring their concerns over the CAA before the government but the protesters did not accept his request. Sudhir Chaudhary was accompanied by senior journalist Deepak Chaurasia during his visit to Shaheen Bagh.

 It may be recalled that Chaurasia was heckled by protesters on Friday when he had gone to Shaheen Bagh to report about the protests. Chaurasia had filed an FIR about the incident and since then journalists from across the country have extended their support to Chaurasia, who works for News Nation.

 Sudhir Chaudhary later tweeted that it seems that law of India is not applicable in Shaheen Bagh and Article 370, a part of the Constitution granting special status to Jammu and Kashmir that was scrapped in August 2019, is now in force in Shaheen Bagh. He also said that it seems visa will be required now to enter Shaheen Bagh. Sudhir Chaudhary also asked whether Shaheen Bagh is not in India and why were protesters raising slogans of Go Back?

 The anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh started on December 15, 2019, days after the passage of Citizenship Amendment Bill in both houses of Parliament. The protest site has now become the hub of political activities with leaders of several opposition parties visiting the spot to extend their solidarity with the protesting women. The protesters have captured one side of the road which connects Delhi to Noida and it has been creating lots of traffic problems for people living in Delhi and Noida.

1481,0,Gujarati,abc,"New Delhi: Triggering a row, BJP leader and Union minister Anurag Thakur on Monday egged on participants of an election rally to raise an incendiary slogan that “traitors should be shot”, after he lashed out at anti-CAA protestors.

 At the rally, Thakur, the minister of state for finance, shouted “desh ke gaddaron ko” to which the crowd responded “goli maro sa*** ko” (shoot down the traitors).

 Addressing the meeting in support of BJP candidate from Rithala, Manish Chaudhary, Thakur raised the pitch of nationalism as he linked opposition parties with anti-CAA protests in Shaheen Bagh and with alleged anti-India slogans, and then asked the crowd to raise the controversial slogan.

 Hitting out at the BJP, Kirti Azad, who is the head of the Delhi Congress campaign committee, its leaders are the “real traitors” as they are working to “destroy” peace and amity.

 The controversial slogan has been raised by some junior BJP leaders of late, including Kapil Mishra, but this is the first time a party functionary of the level of a Union minister has participated in it.

 Thakur is also heard telling the crowd to raising the slogan in such a high voice that Giriraj Singh, a firebrand Hindutva leader and a Union minister, can hear it.

 The BJP’s Rithala candidate is seen as a protegee of Giriraj Singh.

1483,0,Hindi,xyz,"Netflix just dropped the first full-length trailer of Ghost In The Shell: SAC_2045. The streaming giant is bringing back the classic anime series with a whole new look. Ghost in the Shell, successful anime, game and film franchise just got a 3D animation glow-up. The trailer reveals the main characters of the series Major and Batou. Trust me when I say, you aren’t prepared for the drastic change in the visual narrative of the 90s Japanese series.

 Ghost In The Shell: SAC_2045 trailer looks like something that would happen to an anime if it tried a crossover with of Disney’s Pixar films. The 3D animation gives it a cartoonish look that isn’t familiar territory at all. I would get down to complaining had the trailer not looked so good. Yes, Major Kusanagi looks like teen Kusanagi now but will you look at the stunning CGI? You’ll get used to the character designs just as soon as the 1.36-minute clip gets to the action parts, which is immediate!

 The new Ghost in the Shell trailer set in 2045 is packed with action taking us through the exploits of Section 9, a counter-cyberterrorist organisation. In the anime and the previous films, GITS follows Major Mokoto Kusanagi, a cop who works with Public Security Section 9 solving crimes and kicking ass! The action scenes are nicely done with guns, explosions, enough fire-power you get you hooked. When 3D animation did a trial run, it wasn’t a very popular option. Not many anime fans were willing to give, say, Ultraman, a chance. But from the looks of this trailer, I don’t see much reason to complain. Some might still find the style a little difficult to relate with considering the anime’s core plot is deeply philosophical making it a title for mature audiences, decidedly not for children (the Pixar watching audience).

 When Netflix isn’t adding classic anime to its extensive catalogue, it’s producing its own version of anime shows. Just recently they announced The Witcher: Nightmare of the Wolf anime film while Cowboy Bebop’s live-action film is in the works.

 Ghost In The Shell: SAC_2045 is all set to release in April.

1484,0,English,abc,"Lucknow : After Mumbai, it is Lucknow that is bracing up for a night life that has almost been non-existent till now. The Utar Pradesh Excise Department has now allowed restaurants and bars to serve liquor up to 2 a.m. Starred hotels can serve liquor up to 4 a.m.

 Sanjay Bhoosreddy, principal secretary, excise, said that the decision has been taken with a view to promote tourism in the state. The change in the excise policy, however, is restricted to only big cities.

 “We are now giving bars the option of serving liquor till 2 a.m. and to hotels up to 4 a.m., but on certain conditions. Firstly, the option is only open to bars located in metro cities like Lucknow, Agra, Moradabad, Kanpur etc, apart from Noida and Greater Noida. For all bars located in these areas, time can be extended up to 2 a.m. Three, four and five star hotels can open bars up to 4 a.m,” he said.

 With special permission of the district magistrate and additional fees, the hours of serving liquor under a temporary bar license can also be extended by one hour, from midnight to 1 a.m.

 According to the new excise policy, bars will have to pay an additional Rs 2.5 lakh in license fees for the time extension.

 The excise policy has also allowed for an increase in areas in which liquor can be served in hotels. Service time in bars was 12 a.m. earlier and could be extended till 1 a.m. on payment of additional fees. From the existing limit of five spots, areas for serving liquor can be added on the payment of Rs 50,000 for each additional point.

 The excise department will also be giving licenses for serving liquor available in special trains, cruises and airports with a special focus on foreign tourists, at such locations.

 While a train liquor license will cost Rs 10 lakh annually, it will be Rs 3 lakh for a cruise and Rs 5 lakh for airport bars.

 However, the Liquor Traders’ Association of UP is not very happy with the government’s refusal to allow them to open retail shops from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., against the current time of 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.

 K.L. Maurya, secretary of the association, said, “The rules are not friendly for retail shops. There has been an increase in license fees but no increase in maximum retail price of liquor. Timings have also not been extended for retail shops even though hotels are being allowed to serve for longer.”

 The common people also feel that extension of hours of serving liquor would affect the law and order situation.

 “If liquor is served in trains and airports, who will be responsible for ensuring the law and order situation? All night bars are a good idea only when you have adequate police force on the roads,” said P.K. Misra, a retired government employee.

 Rather than just a consumption boost, we also need to see how sustainable economic activity would be post some of the policies that would come through the budget.

 The government would have to facilitate credit flow that has got disrupted over the last 15 months or so, and also make sure that there is some public spending.

 Harsha Upadhyaya, CIO-equity at Kotak Mutual Fund said it would be difficult to rule out choppiness for the market especially with the Union Budget just a few days away and we in the middle of an earning season.

 Talking about his expectations from the budget, he said, “The focus would be on how government manages non-tax revenues given the fact that tax revenues are unlikely to show a big jump going forward.”

 “The other thing which is more structural is that over the last decade, we have seen revenue expenditure growing at about 12 percent CAGR and we know that our economic growth rates have come down sharply below these levels, and if we continue to spend so much on revenue expenditure there is going to be a structural problem in managing our fisc. So we would watch out for that  in the budget,” he added.

 On top of that rather than just a consumption boost, we also need to see how sustainable economic activity would be post some of the policies that would come through the budget, he said.

 We would like to see some push for revival of investment cycle. The private capex is unlikely to pick up immediately given the fact that there is excess capacity across manufacturing industries. So, to that extent the government would have to facilitate credit flow that has got disrupted over the last 15 months or so, and also make sure that there is some public spending so that economic activity begins, which would then fuel the overall economic growth,” said Upadhyaya in an interview with CNBC-TV18.

 Sector specific, Upadhyaya said, “We have been particularly bullish on cement, engineering and capital goods for the last several quarters and we are already seeing signs of these sectors outperforming the overall market.”

 With regards to cement, he said more than volume growth they would benefit from better prices, he said.

 Sharing the rationale for being upbeat on capital goods and engineering, he said there is relative valuation comfort. Although, immediately we are not seeing any improvement in terms of order book, the expectation is that post budget, the order flow will improve and thereafter execution,  he added.

 Xiaomi rolled out the App Drawer to the MIUI Launcher sometime last year but it was limited only to the Chinese version of the custom ROM. Recently, the launcher received an update and it brings the App sharing shortcuts and App shortcuts to it. And, it looks like these will be rolled out to the users of the global ROM as well.

 Going by a recent report, the MIUI Launcher Alpha version of the Global ROM just surfaced online. Whats interesting about this is that it brings the app drawer to Xiaomi smartphones. However, the App Drawer is not enabled by default on the Xiaomi devices and it requires adjusting the Home Screen settings.

 The app drawer feature is available for the Xiaomis MIUI Launcher Alpha version of the Global ROM as an APK file and you need to download the same from here to enjoy using in on your smartphone. Unfortunately, there is no option to understand what the company is planning to roll out in terms of the App Drawer feature for the sable global version of MIUI.

 Currently, those Xiaomi users who can download the APK file of the alpha build of the MIUI Launcher will be able to run MIUI and give a shot at the same. Since it is not a stable version, we can expect some bugs and crashes here and there that could not be suitable for everyday use.

 The latest MIUI Launcher iteration is a tad closer to the POCO launcher app, which comes with features such as app categories, suggestions, a search bar underneath the app drawer, home screen layout, and the ability to change the icon size.

 Recently, Xiaomi confirmed that it is working on the next iteration of its custom ROM, which is MIUI 12. It has also let out the logo of the upcoming iteration. It is likely to bring improved features such as a system-wide dark theme across the system including third-party apps.

 As it is the 10th-anniversary MIUI custom skin edition, the company is likely to bring various interesting features. It is believed that MIUI 12 could be a major improvement in terms of performance and speed.

1487,0,Tamil ,abc,"Can wearing masks protect you from catching Wuhan coronavirus? Best mask to stop the spread of virus  |  Photo Credit: Getty Images

 New Delhi: In wake of the worsening situation in China due to the outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by a new coronavirus, face masks are reportedly selling out across Asian cities as concerns over the spread of the deadly virus grow. As of Tuesday, 28 January 2020, the death toll from the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak has reached 106 in China, while 4,515 cases have been confirmed in 30 provincial-level regions.

 As per reports, China’s National Health Commission has deployed masks to healthcare workers who are responding to the virus outbreak, and millions of face masks have been sent to Wuhan, the city where the new coronavirus was first detected. The World Health Organization has recommended that all healthcare workers treating potential coronavirus cases wear surgical masks, along with protective equipment such as gloves, goggles, and gowns. But, can these face masks actually guard against the deadly virus? The 2019-nCoV is airborne and can be transmitted between humans.

 Surgical masks, also known as procedure masks, were first introduced into hospitals in the late 18th Century. They are also commonly worn by the general population, especially in East Asian countries, to reduce the risk of spreading airborne diseases and protect against high levels of air pollution. Yet, experts and virologists are doubtful about the effectiveness of these surgical masks against airborne diseases.

 But there’s evidence suggesting that surgical masks can help, particularly in preventing hand-to-mouth transmissions. For instance, a 2008 study published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases showed masks, when used correctly, can help prevent the spread of viral infections effectively. Another study published in the Annals of Internal Medicine found similar results. The researchers found that family members could reduce their risk of contracting the flu by 70 per cent when they wear surgical masks and wash their hands often.

 “Routine surgical masks for the public are not an effective protection against viruses or bacteria carried in the air, which was how ‘most viruses’ were transmitted, because they were too loose, had no air filter and left the eyes exposed,” Dr David Carrington, of St George’s, University of London, was quoted as saying by BBC News. Dr Carrington added that these masks could provide some protection against hand-to-mouth transmissions.

 If you’re considering wearing a mask to reduce your risk of infection, here are a few things you need to know such as the types of masks - face masks and respirators.

 Face mask: It is a disposable mask that is approved by the US FDA for use as medical devices. It can help prevent large liquid droplets of bodily fluids that may contain viruses, lowering the risk of catching the virus from another person. Face masks can’t provide complete protection against the airborne virus.

 “They might help, but it’s not clear they give you total protection,” Mark Woolhouse of the University of Edinburgh, UK, told NewScientist.

 Respirators: Also known as N95 respirator masks, respirators can provide more protection compared to surgical masks. They are designed to prevent 95 per cent of small particles (in the air that may contain viruses) from entering the mouth and nose area while ensuring that it fits the wearer properly.

 However, N95 masks can make it more difficult to breathe for a person, which can be challenging for an individual experiencing symptoms of the new coronavirus infection such as shortness of breath, coughing, etc.

 The Bottom Line

 Both types of masks can be beneficial, but studies indicate that respirators are considered much more effective when it comes to preventing the flu virus compared to regular face masks. While to wear a mask or not to wear is completely your choice, make sure that you follow guidelines for proper-mask wearing in case you choose to wear one to help reduce your risk of getting the virus.

 The Wuhan coronavirus was not yet declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the Emergency Committee of the International Health Regulation which met last week, although its risk was assessed to be ‘high’. meanwhile, the World Health Organization South-East Asia has urged countries in the Region to remain vigilant and strengthen the readiness to rapidly detect any case of importation of the new coronavirus and prevent its spread.

 According to Dr Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, the UN health agency is keeping a close watch on the evolving situation and remains committed to work with member countries to scale up readiness and implement IHR core capacities to respond to any importation, emphasising that “we should continue to be vigilant and ready to contain and prevent any further spread”.

 To help protect yourself and others from coronavirus, WHO has provided a set of recommendations which include regular hand washing, avoiding close contact with sich people, not touching face with unwashed hands, maintaining a healthy, lifestyle, etc.

 For more than a month, over 200 women have been joined by hundreds of others every day at South East Delhis Shaheen Bagh at a sit-in protest against the CAA which promises citizenship to only non-Muslim refugees from three neighbouring countries.

 Protests have been ongoing in different parts of the country against the amended Citizenship Act (CAA) which grants citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Buddhists and Christians fleeing religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh if they entered India on or before December 31, 2014.

 Moreover, WHO has issued standard recommendations for the general public (which should be followed by international travellers moving to and from India) to reduce exposure to and transmission of a range of illnesses, which include hand and respiratory hygiene, and safe food practices:

 · Frequently clean hands by using alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water;

 · When coughing and sneezing cover mouth and nose with flexed elbow or tissue – throw tissue away immediately and wash hands;

 · Avoid close contact with anyone who has fever and cough;

 · If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care early and share previous travel history with your healthcare provider;

 · When visiting live markets in areas currently experiencing cases of novel coronavirus, avoid direct unprotected contact with live animals and surfaces in contact with animals;

 · The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products should be avoided. Raw meat, milk or animal organs should be handled with care, to avoid cross-contamination with uncooked foods, as per good food safety practices.

1492,0,Hindi,abc,"Nokia 8.2 will be HMD Global’s first 5G smartphone, according to a new report. At the Mobile World Congress 2020 tech show, HMD Global is rumoured to launch three smartphones- the Nokia 1.3, Nokia 5.2 and the much-awaited Nokia 8.2 5G. The Nokia 8.2 debuted back in December 2018 and several fans have been waiting for the device’s launch. It seems like HMD Global is preparing a major smartphone in the form of Nokia 8.2. The Finnish upstart is also expected to launch Nokia 9.2 PureView smartphone as a successor to Nokia 9 PureView with Snapdragon 865 SoC and 5G support. Going by the new rumour, the Nokia 8.2 is expected to be powered by the Snapdragon 765 chipset which we earlier saw on phones like Xiaomi Redmi K30 5G, Oppo Reno 3 Pro 5G and Realme X50.

 Nokia 8.2 With 5G Support Launching at MWC 2020: What You Need to Know

 Over the last few years, HMD Global had a major presence at the Mobile World Congress tech show. Last year, the company launched phones like Nokia 1 Plus, Nokia 3.2, Nokia 4.2 and Nokia 9 PureView at the MWC 2019, and this year, the brand may launch three phones- the Nokia 1.3, Nokia 5.2 and the Nokia 8.2 5G. This news is reported by Nokiamob.net.

 As for the Nokia 8.2 5G, it’s said to be the same smartphone which was leaked way back in October 2019. The Nokia 8.2 5G’s design will be very much identical to the Nokia 7.2 that was launched later in 2019. The specs of the Nokia 8.2 5G include Qualcomm Snapdragon 765 chipset, AMOLED display with an in-display fingerprint scanner and a 64MP primary sensor. On the front, the Nokia 8.2 is said to come with a 32MP selfie camera. The report also says the phone may have a 3500mAh battery along with a 3.5mm headphone jack.

 HMD Global is said to launch the Nokia 8.2 5G in multiple variants with up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. The Nokia 8.2 5G may not reach the Indian market anytime soon as Indian telcos are yet to chart out their 5G rollout plans.

 In other news, HMD Global is also said to come out with a new series and it will be announced at MWC 2020 itself.

 HMD Global Failed to Make a Mark in 2019

 After reviving the Nokia brand in 2016, HMD Global had a decent 2017 and 2018, but in 2019, the Finnish company failed to make a mark, at least in the Indian market. It launched the Nokia 9 PureView at Rs 49,999 earlier in 2019, however, the phone offered Snapdragon 845 chipset. Besides, we did not see any competitive phones from the brand in 2019 like the Nokia 6.1 Plus, which managed HMD’s mid-range segment in 2018. Other than that, the Nokia 6.2 and Nokia 7.2 offered dated chipsets and even the pricing was not on the mark too.

 The Nokia 8.1 launched in December 2018 was the last decent handset from HMD Global. The phone offered Snapdragon 710 chipset at a launch price of Rs 26,990 and it’s now selling for around Rs 15,000. It will be interesting to see how HMD Global manages to take on the brands like Xiaomi, Realme, Samsung, Honor and even Vivo. The only advantage of choosing Nokia smartphones right now is Android One certification. Nokia smartphones launched back in 2017 will receive Android 10 update this year which is an excellent thing.

 Apple has booked orders for as many as 65 million units of current models, primarily the iPhone 11 series, and as many as 15 million units of a new low-cost model, the paper reported, citing unidentified people.

 Apple suppliers plan to begin assembling the low-cost iPhone next month and they have been boosting overall iPhone production, Bloomberg News reported last week. Apple expects iPhone sales to return to growth this year because of strong demand and aims to ship more than 200 million for the year, Bloomberg reported last year.

 The iPhone 11 and 11 Pro models were well received on their debut in the fall and their sales in China have been particularly strong, outselling 2018’s releases in a market that has otherwise been shrinking.

 The Cupertino, California-based company is expected to officially unveil the new low-cost phone as early as March, one person familiar said last week. The assembly work for the new handset will be split among Hon Hai Precision Industry, Pegatron Corp and Wistron Corp., the people added.

 It was widely expected that Ajay Tyagi would get at least two years extension given his stellar performance on the job.

 Surabhi Pandey New Delhi  28 January 2020, 11:31:14 AM

 The Union Finance Ministry has invited applications for the next chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) to succeed Ajay Tyagi, whose three-year term comes to an end next month. Tyagi, a 1984 batch IAS officer of Himachal Pradesh cadre, was appointed as head of the market regulator in 2017 for the period of three years. He assumed charge on March 1, 2017. It was widely expected that Tyagi would get at least two years extension given his stellar performance on the job.

 However, the public notice dated January 24 inviting application from eligible candidates indicates that the government in not inclined to give an extension of two years to the incumbent. Applications of eligible candidates in prescribed proforma along with attested copies of annual confidential report for the last five years, vigilance clearance and no penalty and integrity certificate in case of serving government employees should reach on or before February 10, a public notice issued by the Finance Ministrys Economic Affairs Department said.

 In the past, the government has given extension to UK Sinha for three years, making him the second longest-serving chief of Sebi. In case of Tyagi, the government issued appointment notification twice.

 New Delhi, January 28: Demonising the anti-CAA protesters at Shaheen Bagh, Delhi BJP lawmaker Parvesh Verma said the demonstrators will resort to rape and murder if the AAP government is not uprooted from the state. Vermas remarks comes amid a polarising debate over the women-led agitation against CAA-NRC currently underway at the Shaheen Bagh.

 Verma, while speaking to news agency ANI, said a section of Delhi residents may end up meeting the fate of Kashmiri Pandits if the BJP is not elected to power in the state assembly. The protest at Shaheen Bagh, he alleged, has not only received tacit support from the AAP, but is absolutely backed by the Arvind Kejriwal government.

 Lakhs of people gather there (Shaheen Bagh). People of Delhi will have to think and take a decision. Theyll enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them. Theres time today, Modi ji and Amit Shah wont come to save you tomorrow, Verma said.

 According to Verma, the protests at Shaheen Bagh wont last longer than an hour after the BJP forms government in the state.

 Bournemouth, January 28: Mikel Arteta hailed Arsenals hungry youngsters after Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah fired their side into the FA Cup fifth round with a 2-1 win against Bournemouth on Monday.

 Arteta turned to youth at Dean Court and Saka, Nketiah and Joe Willock repaid Arsenalthe Arsenal managers faith with influential displays that secured a trip to third-tier Portsmouth.

 Saka gave Arsenal an early lead as the 18-year-old full-back bagged his third goal of the season with a superb strike.

 Nketiah got the second before the interval to ensure Arteta took another step towards emulating his FA Cups triumph as an Arsenal player in 2014 and 2015.

 Sam Surridge got one back for Bournemouth in the closing minutes, but it was too late to salvage a replay.

 Im very pleased. Always tough to come here and win, weve done it with a young team as well, Arteta said.

 I have a lot of faith in them. I think they are developing really well. They are willing and hungry and will only get better.

 Languishing in 10th place in the Premier League after failing to win any of their last three games, this was a welcome boost for Arteta as Arsenal built on their hard-fought draw at Chelsea last week.

 It was Arsenals third win in eight matches under Arteta in all competitions, with just one defeat in that run.

 It was not all plain sailing by the seaside for Arteta, who added: We scored two fantastic goals, but after that we became a little bit sloppy and I didnt like that very much.

 Artetas first match in charge of Arsenal was a 1-1 Premier League draw at Bournemouth in December, but his team looked far more accomplished this time, even without several key players.

 With Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang still suspended, 18-year-old striker Gabriel Martinelli started for Arsenal.

 Martinelli had scored in Arsenals past two Premier League games to reach 10 goals for the season.

 But the Brazilian isnt just a poacher and he showed his creative vision as Arsenal made a perfect start in the fifth minute.

 As a 22-pass Arsenal move approached an eye-catching crescendo, Willocks surge opened up the Bournemouth defence.

 Willock picked out Martinelli, who deftly moved the ball onto Saka when a more selfish player would have shot and he smashed a thunderous drive into the roof of the net from an acute angle.

 Arteta had made five changes from the Chelsea match, with Nketiah making his first Arsenal start since January last year against Blackpool in the FA Cup.

 Nketiah was recently recalled from a loan spell at second-tier Leeds over concerns he wasnt playing enough, but the 20-year-old showed his potential in the 26th minute as he doubled Arsenals lead.

 Unable to contain Willock and Saka, Bournemouth were carved open as the midfielders pass found the defender in acres of space on the left.

 Sakas cross into the six-yard box was perfect for Nketiah and he slotted in his first Arsenal goal since May.

 Completely outclassed for the first 30 minutes, Bournemouth finally had a sight of goal when Harry Wilsons volley was saved by Emiliano Martinez.

 Artetas men didnt have it all their own way in the second half and Martinez took out his own player when he clattered into Shkodran Mustafi in a bid to catch a cross.

 Mustafi had to be stretchered off as a result of the clash and Arteta said: Well have to assess tomorrow but when Mustafi has to come off normally it is not a good sign.

 The hapless Martinez nearly gifted Bournemouth a goal moments later when he missed with his attempt to punch clear, but Jack Simpson headed just wide of the empty net.

 Surridge punished sloppy defending to tap in from Simon Francis cross deep into stoppage time, but Arsenals rookies held on.

1506,0,Gujarati,xyz,"A study conducted by the researchers of UCLA says rhinoplasty or cosmetic nose surgery is a way to make women look younger up to three years. They used a specific type of artificial intelligence called machine learning to come to this conclusion. This was recently published in the journal – Aesthetic Surgery Journal.

 The researchers conducted the study by using the technology to study the before and after photos of a total of 100 females aged between 16 to 72. All of the women associated with the study had undergone rhinoplasty for cosmetic reasons by a UCLA surgeon and others.

 After 12 or more weeks later, researchers studied the standardized photographs of the women using the technology that estimates the age of a person by cropping the face from a photograph and then reaching a prediction using the algorithm.

 “Rhinoplasty is widely recognized as a facial beautification procedure, but it isn’t commonly known for its anti-aging effects,” said the lead researcher, Dr. Robert Dorfman. Rhinoplasty consists of altering bone and cartilage structurally through small incisions inside the nose and when necessary around the nostril, during the time when the patient is under anesthesia. “This technology allows us to accurately estimate age in an objective way and has proven to recognize patterns and features of aging beyond what the human eye can perceive,” he said.

 The results of the study were dramatic in women over the age of 40, some of whom were estimated to look seven years younger after rhinoplasty. However, because the sample size of the 40-plus group was small of about 25 women, the researchers said that further studies need to be done to validate the results. The median age of the participants in the study was 32.

 According to the researchers nose is never taken as a focus to treat ageing but like any other feature of the body, nose which is made up of soft tissue, bone and cartilage, ages too. “The nose loses support as it ages and can take on a more prominent or droopy appearance,” said another researcher Dr. Jason Roostaeian. The nose is also affected when other features of the face age.

 “When we lose facial fat and volume in our cheeks, which are the canvas that our nose sits on, the nose becomes more prominent,” said Roostaeian. “This is something we have subjectively thought for many decades but now we have objective evidence through artificial intelligence to support this,” he added.

 The researchers further said that the youthful appearance of the entire face can be refined by refining the nose.

 The Malang trailer has already raised the excitement amongst the audience. The movie will showcase the different avatars of all the characters. Jessie is one of the characters which has left the audience filled with excitement and is portrayed by Elli AvrRam. Elli AvrRams character is interesting and important in Malang, the details of Ellis role had been kept under wraps so far.

 With dreadlocks and tattoos covering her head and body, the actress has nailed the grunge look. Talking about how she landed up doing Jessies character in Malang, Elli says, I was overjoyed when Mohit sir called me to audition for Jessies part in the film. I wanted this film so badly that I nailed it in my first audition. He was happy with my audition and wanted me to look absolutely different and stand out in the film. For me, its a very tricky character to play.

 Spilling beans on how the team put together the look, she says, We tried several looks for the role, but when I put on this wig with the dreadlocks and it was a unanimous yes from the entire team. I dont think there has ever been a character like this attempted before in films. They wanted tattoos, but I requested Mohit sir to let me pick the tattoos myself. It gave me a better understanding of the world that shes coming from. I have never been to any rave parties and Jessie is somewhat a wild child. But, I have given this role my all.

 Team Malang is on the promotional spree as the film is getting nearer to release and the excitement that has touched the sky.

 Ganesh Acharya is back in news for the wrong reasons. A 33-year-old assistant female choreographer has filed a complaint against him at the Maharashtra Womens Commission and Amboli police station in Mumbai of depriving her of working in the film industry, demanding commission from income and forcing her to watch adult videos.

 In her complaint, the woman mentioned that Ganesh has been harassing her continuously ever since he was appointed as the General Secretary of the Indian Film & Television Choreographers Association. She further claimed that he misused his position to get her membership removed from the association when she didnt listen to him.

 The female choreographer further accused Ganesh of forcing her to watch adult videos. She said that Ganesh used to make inappropriate comments on her and would also ask her to watch porn videos, which she never agreed.

 She also claimed that he has been mentally harassing her ever since she didnt give in to his pressure of shelling out extra Rs 500 out of her share money just like the rest of the dancers.

 This is not the first time Ganesh has hit a controversy. Earlier, he had an ugly spat with veteran choreographer, Saroj Khan where she accused him of using his position to manipulate dancers and malign the old association (CDA). In reply, the choreographer hit back at her accusations and said, Saroj ji is speaking wrong. When the CDA was closed why did not she came to help us to open it.

 Tata Motors is all set to launch their all-new Nexon EV in the Indian market. The Tata Nexon EV is the first pure-electric compact-SUV offering from the brand and will rival the likes of the MG ZS EV and the Hyundai Kona EV for now.

 The Tata Nexon EV comes with a 95kW electric motor, paired with a 30.2kWh lithium-ion battery pack. The electric powertrain on the Nexon EV produces 129bhp and 245Nm of torque and claims a maximum range of 312km on a single charge (ARAI-certified).

 The Tata Nexon comes with a host of features and is based on the facelift-version of the conventional-powered Nexon SUV. This translates to a number of design changes, additional features and a host of safety equipment as well. We recently drove the Tata Nexon EV — here is our detailed review.

1515,0,Gujarati,pqr,"OYO now has to explain its restructuring to the court-appointed arbitrator and ZO Rooms

 ZO Rooms filed a petition filed in the Delhi High Court on January 21, 2020

 OYO has been given 2 weeks to respond to arbitrator

 OYO’s restructuring is now receiving shocks from the past as a former hotel operator and acquisition target, ZO Rooms, has escalated its ongoing case against the SoftBank-backed company.

 The case has been in court for the last few years. OYO now has to explain its restructuring to the court-appointed arbitrator and to ZO Rooms. The first complaint in this case was filed by ZO Rooms in the Delhi High Court in 2017, after a proposed takeover deal by OYO fell through in 2016.

 On January 21, 2020, ZO Rooms reportedly filed a plea against OYO’s decision to restructure its businesses and house them in new entities without informing the arbitrator or ZO Rooms. ZO Rooms was seeking a 7% stake in OYO parent — Oravel Stays as damages in the original complaint. It is now saying that since OYO has demerged its units, it will adversely affect the claim sought by ZO Rooms in the ongoing arbitration.

 It is to be noted that OYO has divided its businesses into additional units — OYO Hotels and Homes and Oravel Stays Singapore. ZO Rooms has now made these companies party to its arbitration case. ZO Rooms is concerned that if OYO’s units are transferred or devalued, its claim of 7% of stake of OYO’s parent company will be valued at a lesser point.

 In its order on January 24, the Delhi High Court has reportedly asked OYO to file a response on the matter to the arbitrator within two weeks.

 The Delhi high court has reportedly mentioned that the petition stands disposed of and the arbitrator should fix a date of hearing with consent of both the parties.

 An OYO spokesperson reportedly said that it cannot comment specifically on the matter due to the prohibition imposed by judicial forums. “Important to note that this restructuring doesn’t have any adverse impact on the company’s value. The entire demerger process occurred and necessary filings were completed across different stages since March 2019 and even communicated publicly through newspaper advertisements in June 2019 and September 2019,” it added.

 OYO had signed a term sheet to acquire the assets of ZO Rooms in 2015. However, after a long-delay, OYO called off the deal. Later, OYO filed a criminal case against ZO Rooms stating alleging continuous inconvenience and harassment by founders of ZO Rooms.

 ZO Room’s parent company Zostel Hospitality Pvt. Ltd, in response, filed a petition on February 2, 2018, alleging that OYO had acquired  data of employees, assets, hotel properties under the pretext of accelerating the process of acquisition and is now refusing to pay the dues for the business acquired.

 In October 2018, the Supreme Court accepted the arbitration petition by ZO Rooms and appointed Justice A M Ahmadi, former Chief Justice of India as the sole arbitrator.

 The Flipkart co-founder was very clear that there was no material consideration for the resignation.

 Following his departure from Flipkart, Sachin Bansal has placed strong bets in the financial services sector. Through his investment firm Navi Technologies, he picked up a majority stake in the non-banking financial company (NBFC) Chaitanya Rural Intermediation Development Services (CRIDS) in September last year by investing Rs 739 crore. CRIDS is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chaitanya India Fin Credit Private Limited (CIFCPL).

 He has also applied for a universal banking licence with the RBI. Besides this, he has bought out Essel Mutual Fund and DHFL General Insurance. There were also investments into treasury operations of Piramal Enterprises, which include venture debt and debt papers.

 Recently, International Finance Corporation, the arm of World Bank, had announced the investment of Rs 210 crore in Navi Technologies, picking up 4.5 percent stake.

1517,0,Gujarati,abc,"Paytm Payments Bank Ltd (PPBL) on Monday said it has added a new feature that analyses rogue apps on user devices that may trigger fraudulent transactions and advises users to uninstall such apps.

 It is also leveraging artificial intelligence to immediately identify and block suspicious activities, and is undertaking periodic awareness drives throughout the country to educate users about fraud calls and SMSes, the bank said.

 PPBL MD and CEO Satish Gupta said the bank is putting all efforts and resources into ensuring every user transaction is safe and secure on its platform.

 This security feature will scan the apps installed on the user device and will pop up a security alert whenever a dangerous app is found that may put the users accounts at risk. No transactions will be possible until the user uninstalls that fraudulent app, he added.

 Gupta said PPBL has already seen cases where these features have stopped attempts to defraud customers.

 The statement added that PPBL is using leveraging AI to instantly detect suspicious transactions.

 Depending on the identified threat level of a transaction, the AI either slows it down or completely blocks the payment from getting completed. The AI has been specifically designed keeping in mind the patterns of the various scams being run by fraudsters and is, therefore, able to combat most attacks on user accounts in real-time, it added.

 The statement said the bank has a dedicated team of over 200 cybersecurity experts to ensure round-the-clock security of every user transaction.

 The teams closely work with all State and Central police forces and cyber cells as well as telecom companies to detect, prevent and report fraudulent transactions for immediate action, it added.

 Barcelona president Josep Maria Bartomeu confirmed the LaLiga champions are considering a move for Valencia forward Rodrigo Moreno.

 Rodrigo has emerged as a target for Barca, who are in the market for attacking reinforcements after Luis Suarezs season-ending injury.

 Spain international Rodrigo, who netted 15 times across all competitions last term, has scored four goals for Valencia this season.

 Asked about the mounting speculation, Bartomeu said: We dont talk about players from other teams. But [Rodrigos] name is on the table of the coaches.

 And a replacement will arrive. I do not know whether it will be from Barcelona B or from outside [the club].

 I like many players.

 Barca captain and six-time Ballon dOr winner Lionel Messi was also a topic of conversation.

 In 2017, Messi signed a new contract with Barca until 2021 and the Spanish giants want to extend the 32-year-olds deal.

 He will be done with Barcelona when he wants. His relationship with Barcelona is forever, Bartomeu said.

 He has plenty more football to play here. Leo Messi will be around for a while.

1520,0,Tamil ,pqr,"London: “Friends” alum David Schwimmer has defended the beloved 1990s sitcom after younger viewers called out the show for its “problematic” storylines, describing it as transphobic, homophobic and sexist, and the actor has suggested a more diverse remake of the series.

 “Maybe there should be an all-black ‘Friends’ or an all-Asian ‘Friends’,” Schwimmer told The Guardian.

 The show was a phenomenal hit during its decade-long run till 2004 and later went on to find cult status with new audiences through TV reruns and Netflix.

 Schwimmer, who played Ross Geller, one of the six leads in the NBC series, said he was “well aware of the lack of diversity” on “Friends” and even campaigned for years to have his character date women of colour.

 “One of the first girlfriends I had on the show was an Asian American woman, and later I dated African American women. That was a very conscious push on my part,” the actor said.

 Ross dated Julie, played by Lauren Tom, in season two and Charlie Wheeler, essayed by Aisha Tyler, in season nine and ten.

 The actor also made a reference to a Christmas episode where the makers touched upon the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. Ross and his sister Monica, played by Courteney Cox, were depicted as Jews in the series.

 “It’s interesting also how the show handled the Judaism of the characters. I don’t think that was earth-shattering or ground-breaking at all, but I for one was glad that we had at least one episode where it wasn’t just about Christmas.

 “It was also Hanukkah and, even though I played the Hanukkah armadillo, I was glad that we at least acknowledged the differences in religious observation,” he added.

 Schwimmer also expressed his frustration at older shows being judged out of context.

 “The truth is also that show was ground-breaking in its time for the way in which it handled so casually sex, protected sex, gay marriage and relationships. The pilot of the show was my character’s wife left him for a woman and there was a gay wedding, of my ex and her wife, that I attended,” he said.

 Ross’ wife Carol Willick, who upon realisation that she is a lesbian, leaves him for her friend Susan Bunch (Jessica Hecht). Actors Anita Barone and Jane Sibbet played Carol in the show.

 “I feel that a lot of the problem today in so many areas is that so little is taken in context. You have to look at it from the point of view of what the show was trying to do at the time.

 “I’m the first person to say that maybe something was inappropriate or insensitive, but I feel like my barometer was pretty good at that time. I was already really attuned to social issues and issues of equality,” Schwimmer said.

1521,0,Gujarati,xyz,"Du Plessis appeared to bump into Buttler while exchanging words with Broad on the fourth afternoon of the fourth Test, which England won by 191 runs.

 The incident happened as Du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen were frustrating England during a 92-run partnership on a hot afternoon. The England players seemed to be getting annoyed at Du Plessis habit of picking up the ball after playing a defensive shot.

 After a throw from Sam Curran hit his pads, there were some heated words and Du Plessis appeared to walk into Buttler. Thats part of my character, said Du Plessis on Monday.

 If you go back youll find Im always involved in a little bit of something in a game, trying to show that fight as a leader of the team to show you dont stand back to opposition.

 Its not like Im looking for it but if it comes across my way I wont back down. So that was just him (Broad) saying something to me and me saying something back. I dont think either Jos or myself knew we touched each other, said Du Plessis, who is under pressure after a poor run of form.

 It was just myself and Broady having a go at each other at that stage and it was him trying to get between me and him. There was no malicious intent. England captain Joe Root said he thought the incident was absolute nothing and that at the time he was worried that it would make Du Plessis more determined.

 I thought Faf was using it to get himself going and my worry was that it was going to work in his favour, he said. It was absolute handbags.

 A miserable series for Du Plessis was completed after the close of play on Monday when South Africa were fined 60 percent of their match fee and deducted six World Test Championship points.

 A day before the 71st Republic Day the government announced the list of the 21 recipients of the Padma Shri Award 2020 and one name that created curiosity was Harekala Hajabba.

 A humble 86-year-old orange seller from Karnataka, Harekala Hajabba would have never thought of winning the highest civilian awards for the work he was doing selflessly for years now.

 IFS officer Praveen Kaswan took to his twitter and shared the inspiring story of Harekala. This fruit seller from Dakshin Kannada is educating poor children in his village of Newpadapu from a decade in a mosque, he wrote.

 He further added that Hajabba received the news when he was standing in a line on a ration shop and authorities informed him that he got #Padma Shri.

 The tweet has gone viral now. It has received more than 6.8k likes and almost 2k replies.

 According to a report on the BBC, there was no school in Harekala Hajabbas village, Newpadapu. He saved 2000 from his earnings to set up one in the mosque. As the number of students grew, he used all his savings and even took a loan to buy land for the school.

 Hajabba is uneducated and in conversation with The News Minute reveals that an encounter with foreign tourists led him to his decision.

 The couple were asking me the price of oranges, but then I did not understand. Despite my best efforts, I could not talk in anything besides Tulu and Beary language. The couple walked away. I felt very bad and felt that at least the children of my own village should not be in a similar situation. I realised the manner in which communication can help one to progress in life, and at the same time bring people together, he said to The News Minute.

 Hajabbas story has inspired many and people are praising him for his selfless act.

 He is the real influencer, the real hero and a deserved recipient of the recognition. M really happy to see today the country is recognizing the efforts of a common Indian in the likes of him and Tulasi Gowda ji.

 Hats off to Harekala Hajabba for the great dedication in the field of education. By sacrificing his personal life and working all day to develop the school himself nurtured for the cause of deprived children of society. He would have got the Padma Shri even earlier.

1524,0,Telugu,xyz,"Greece aims to exploit untapped tourism revenue by allowing diving for post-19th century shipwrecks in the near future, Tourism Minister Harry Theocharis said Monday as his country is already enjoying growth in the key sector. In an interview with AFP, Theocharis said tourists would over the next few years be allowed to explore wrecks that were off limits before. The minister announced the plans as the government forecast an increase of 10 percent in visitor revenues this year. Shipwreck tourism is not part of the 2020 revenue estimate. “We will liberalise the creation of diving parks. We will allow diving in shipwrecks over 50 years old, which are currently not allowed,” Harry Theocharis told AFP in an interview. A bill would be introduced “within a month” to open shipwrecks “after 1860” and until 1970 to divers, he said.

 No details were given Monday, but the Greek seabed holds a large number of shipwrecks from World War I and World War II, including the Britannic, fleet mate of the Titanic, a British hospital ship sunk in 1916 near the island of Kea.

 As Greece slowly emerges from a decade-long financial crisis it relies heavily on tourism to boost economic growth and accelerate job creation.

 The sector accounts for about a quarter of the country’s gross domestic product and employs around 20 percent of the total workforce.

 The ministry earlier Monday said tourism revenues in 2019 grew by 12 percent at 18.1 billion euros ($20 billion) from about 16 billion in 2018.

 It expects arrivals will increase by five percent in 2020 from last year when they were 31 million, up 3.6 percent from the previous year.

 - ‘Untapped potential’ -

 Greece currently draws over three times more tourists than its 10.8 million residents, but Athens still has “a lot of untapped potential,” the minister said Monday.

 Shortly after the governnment took power in July the sector suffered a blow with the collapse of British travel giant Thomas Cook, which left thousands of tourists stranded on the Greek islands.

 Theocharis said there was an immediate impact of over 120 million euros in unpaid invoices to Greek operators, and another 500 million euros in lost contracts.

 Over 3,000 employees in Greece were also affected, losing seasonal jobs a month early, the minister said.

 “Given the issues that arose during the year, it’s obvious that we are relieved” by the 2019 results, he said, adding that negotiations with airlines and other operators had “effectively covered all 1.6 million airline seats” lost.

 Theocharis acknowledges “strain in the infrastructure” of some successful island destinations, but insists Greece is “nowhere near the kind of (congestion) issues other destinations are currently facing.”

 For top island destinations such as Santorini, he says officials are “working to establish a berth allocation system which is more granular... to create incentives or disincentives to spread out (cruise ship) flows,” he says.

 Theocharis and other ministers travel to Paris on Tuesday in a business delegation headed by Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis to attract investment to Greece.

 - ‘Play it safer’ -

 The eight-billion-euro project involving residences, hotels, shopping centres and cultural venues, has been delayed for years, but the government is hopeful construction will begin this year.

 Greece’s gaming regulator last week selected US operator Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment for a new casino that is part of the complex, one of the steps needed to get the project moving.

 “Some investors want to play it safer. For those, a big proportion of the investing community, they need to see it happening before they take the risk,” Theocharis said.

 “When we see the first bulldozers (at Hellinikon), it will be a significant milestone (showing) that we’re open for business.”

 Fuel prices in India were lowered for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday as international oil rates continued to slide over fears of the coronavirus outbreak in China.

 Petrol prices per litre were cut by 11 paise to Rs 73.60 in New Delhi, Rs 76.22 in Kolkata, Rs 79.21 in Mumbai and Rs 76.44 in Chennai. Diesel prices per litre were reduced by 13 paise to Rs 66.58 in New Delhi, Rs 68.94 in Kolkata, Rs 69.79 in Mumbai and Rs 70.33 in Chennai.

 International oil benchmark Brent crude was down by 0.3 percent to $59.17 per barrel on Tuesday. On Monday, the index had slipped to its lowest in three months to $58.50.

 Fuel prices in India are based on international oil price movements and rupees exchange rate.

 Chinese health authorities said that the coronavirus outbreak has killed 106 people and infected 4,515 raising fears across the globe. Countries, including the US, have issued warnings against travel to China, leaving millions of travellers stranded at the biggest holiday in the Chinese calendar.

 Investors in oil are concerned that travel restrictions and fall in economic growth will dampen demand for crude and its products while supply remains high.

 There are concerns that spread of infection, transportation disruptions, cancellation of group tours from China and an extension in the Lunar Holiday will likely hurt the global economy. If the situation takes longer to subside, it will hurt exports, output and corporate profits of companies that are impacted by production and consumption in China.

 Even as the markets continue to remain just 2 per cent below their historic lows, there are many good quality stocks that have dived to 52-week lows. Here are a few of them:

 ONGC

 Indias largest oil and gas exploration company is trading at Rs 116.80, which is just 1 per cent away from its 52-week low of Rs 115.55.

 A fall in crude prices has pushed the stock lower. Moreover, divestment of stake sale in the company may also be an overhang on the stock. However, at these levels the stock is trading at a 1-year forward p/e of just 5 times, which is almost half of the valuations when compared to global peers.

 At the current price of Rs 116.40, the stock yields a dividend of more than 6 per cent, which is not bad at all.

 Oil India

 Oil India is another oil and gas exploration company like ONGC, which is just 1 per cent lower than its 52-week low price of Rs 137.

 Again, the stock at the current market price of Rs 138.70, gives a good dividend yield of 7.30 per cent. If both these companies increase their dividends, the dividend yield is significanly higher.

 Hindustan Zinc

 Indias largest Zinc and silver producer has seen its share price drop to Rs 200, which is just three per cent away from a 52-week low. There were hopes that the board would declare dividends at the last board meeting when quarterly numbers were declared.

 However, that did not happen. The stock would remain a good bet for its dividend yields.

 Indian oil Corporation

 This is another stock that is just 3 per cent away from its 52-week low and is currently trading at Rs 117.40. Government owned oil marketing company stocks and those from the oil exploration business have both seen their share prices drop.

 One reason for the same could be the divestment. However, most of these stocks do offer value.

 Marico

 FMCG major Marico, is a stock that is just 4 per cent away from its 52-week lows. The stock is trading at Rs 339, against its 52-week low of Rs 324. FMCG stocks have been hurt on account of the economic slowdown. Some of these stocks could be a good bets for the long-term. If some of the PSU stocks declare good dividends, they would be ideal, given that dividends are tax free in the hands of investors up to a sum of Rs 10 lakhs.

 Analysts are of the view that this budget would focus on boosting consumer demand through additional tax sops as economic growth falters.

 Income tax sops

 If income tax sops, particularly for the lower tax bracket individuals goes through, we would see significant benefit to companies from the two-wheeler space like Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors, Hero MotoCorp. Apart from this FMCG stocks like Colgate, Hindustan Unilever, Dabur etc., will benefit, due to increase in the disposable income.

 Doing away with dividend distribution tax

 If the government does away with the dividend distribution tax that is presently paid by companies, it could benefit a host of high dividend paying companies like ONGC, Coal India, Hindustan Zinc, Vedanta etc.

 In fact, some of these companies may go out and declare even higher dividends.

 Housing sector

 It is highly possible that some relief could be provided for the housing sector as well. This could be by way of further enhancing the tax relief on housing loans or re-defining affordable housing.

 Several companies that could benefit from the above include names like Sobha, Indiabulls Housing Finance, Purvanakara etc., might benefit.

 A word of caution

 All the above are merely based on assumptions and are speculative in nature. We do not know what the Union Budget has in store. Given the very delicate situation of the governments finances, one would like to believe that a few giveaways is possible, but, all of them happening would be too far-fetched to imagine.

 It is important to tread with extreme caution ahead of the Union Budget. Investors are advised to stick to high quality dividend paying stocks.

 In fact, some of the government owned companies, which are paying regular dividends, maybe excellent pick for their dividends and their dividend yields.

 Considering the writ petition by the petitioners on Monday, the court has sought the views of Central and state governments on the matter.

 The petitioners, a business man and an IT professional had met each other in May 2018 and fallen in love.

 After being in a relationship for two months, they decided to get hitched.

 In September last year, they got married in a private ceremony.

 However, the religious authorities declined to solemnise the wedding and hence the couple decided to get their marriage registered under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, which does not recognise homosexual marriages.

 In their plea, the gay couple stated thatit was aggrieved by the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 whereby the law provided therein only permits a heterosexual (opposite sex) couple to get married and a homosexual couple like them is denied equal access to the institution of marriage.

 They claim that the impugned provisions of the Act violate their fundamental rights and are thus “illegal and unconstitutional” to that extent.

 Seeking declarations in this connection and to obtain the relief for getting married under the Act, the writ petition was being moved jointly by the petitioners, who submitted that they have suffered public humiliation after they disclosed their love for each other.

 But, greater is the insult and indignity the petitioners have suffered at the hands of law, which refuses to recognise their union, causing immense pain and agony to them, they said in the petition.

 Noting that the impugned provisions restrict the process of application, solemnisation and registration of marriages to heterosexual couples alone and exclude homosexual couples from its ambit, the petitioners said it must be held “unconstitutional” and thus be struck or read down to that extent of illegality.

 NCMEC, established by the US Congress in 1984, is a private non-profit organisation involved in reducing child sexual exploitation and preventing child victimisation, in addition to similar issues related to children. Using tip-offs from individuals and service providers, and numerous software, the organisation, tracks child pornography online.

 The obtained information is then shared with law enforcement agencies in the form of Tipline reports.

 According to a Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) official, the Indian government had signed an agreement with NCMEC last year following which they have started sending their Tipline reports on child pornography videos being uploaded online. As of January 23, we have received over 25,000 such reports over the past five months, The Indian Express quoted an MHA official as saying.

 According to the NCMEC report, most of the Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) was uploaded in Delhi.

 While Delhi has topped the list of states where most child porn is uploaded, other top states include Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP and West Bengal. Depending upon what the police agencies in these states find in investigations, FIRs will be registered, the official said.

 The official added that FIRs will be registered based on the findings by police agencies in these states. A senior IPS officer from Maharashtra said that these cases were geo-tagged, and Excel sheets with PDFs attached passed on to jurisdictions under which the locations were based. Also, seven FIRs have already been registered in the state.

 The officer said that Mumbai, Thane, and Pune had the highest number of such cases in the state. In Maharashtra, urban centres like Mumbai, Thane and Pune have the maximum number of such cases. Mumbai alone has nearly 500 such incident reports, the officer said.

 While Maharashtra recieved the information from the cyber police last month, numerous other states recieved it earlier. Delhi, Gujarat, and Kerala police are among those that have already made arrests in some of these cases.

 When you press the button on the EVM, do it with such force that the current is felt at Shaheen Bagh, Amit Shah said while campaigning for the BJP ahead of the Delhi election. ‘Prevent a thousand Shaheen Baghs’ was his message. Then law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad called a press conference to accuse Arvind Kejriwal of standing with Shaheen Bagh protesters.

 Clearly, Shaheen Bagh is no longer just the name of a locality or a local site of protest. It has already etched its name on the global stage with the likes of Tahrir Square in Egypt, Taksim Square in Turkey, and Wall Street in New York. Every night Shaheen Bagh persists, it creates more of itself in different corners of India. More Shaheen Baghs – such as in Park Circus in Kolkata, Ghanta Ghar in Lucknow, and Mosque Road in Bengaluru.

 As one placard reads: “You divide, we multiply”.

 Be it Shaheen Bagh or any of the other sit-ins against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, it is clear that these are not ordinary protest sites. No pliant audience sits listening to political speeches and disperses soon after, leaving just flyers on the road. At any point during the day, Shaheen Bagh is alive. Children sit with mothers, grandmothers sit near the stage, food is brought in from homes, art is made, songs are sung.

 Ignoring the armed police who loom like dementors, protesters have turned Shaheen Bagh into a site for the fearless and the determined. Revolution, after all, is a carnival of people power.

 Some cynics ask, ‘What have the protests achieved and can they change Narendra Modi and Shah’s plans?’ For the first time since Independence, the Muslims of India have found a language, a new grammar of politics to articulate their pain and their aspirations. For the first time in the last five years of Modi rule, those who could not step out after each lynching, those who had to keep quiet after the unjust Ayodhya verdict, those who have been overtaken by fear and despair, are speaking up. A muted community is speaking up for itself. The Muslim youth and women in these sit-ins today are more aware, more up to date, more informed, more critical, more conscious than the average Indian studying in ‘WhatsApp university’. This, for me, is the biggest achievement yet of our collective fight back.

 For far too long, Muslims have been reduced to a silent vote bank, advised to lie low and let others fight for them. These ‘others’ can be self-proclaimed secularists, liberals and even anti-caste warriors. While many of them are genuine well-wishers of the community, some just wanted to satiate their self-interest at the cost of Muslims and win votes. Muslims should remain silent, they would say, or else it will only end up helping the Hindutva-wadis polarise society. And we listened to their advice for many decades now.

 What has this tactic achieved for Muslims or for India? Has their silence checked the polarisation of India? Could the unbridled rise of fascism be contained? Did it save secularism? By avoiding association with Muslims, could the opposition make a dent in the vote count of the BJP? Far from political security, it also did not guarantee social or economic security.

 The illiteracy rate is the highest among Muslims (42.7 per cent) compared to any other community – SC, ST or OBC. Muslims have the lowest rate of enrollment in higher education, lower than even other marginalised communities. In an economy where job security is eroding fast, Muslims are perhaps the worst hit. The Sachar Committee, the Ranganath Misra Committee and the Amitabh Kundu Committee – one after the other attested to the profound deprivation of the largest minority in India. Their share in salaried employment, in government jobs, in police, in army or among industrialists are all disproportionately low. The only place we are over-represented are in India’s jails.

 So, how did our silence help?

 Today, through the CAA protests, Muslims are not just speaking, they are also rewriting politics. Contrary to mainstream political thought, Muslims aren’t a vote block or a homogeneous community. But with these protests, many dormant emotions (or forcefully suppressed ones) have been set in motion in the Muslim community. So much so that even those who have occupied centre stage “representing” the community for far too long are being challenged from within. And by whom? The most marginalised Muslim voices – that of the women and the young.

 This internal influx is bothering those parties or people who want to deal with Muslims as a monolithic vote bank and then use them again as bait to stereotype the community. This symbiotic relationship between the system and traditional spokespersons has been unsettled. Top-down Muslim politics has been shaken from voices on the ground.

 A secular intellectual wrote an article after the Ayodhya judgment, chiding Muslims in the most patronising tone about how they were complicit in the final verdict. According to Javed Anand, by protesting the Shah Bano judgement and getting it reversed, the Muslims were complicit in ‘giving’ an agenda to the Hindu Right. While giving the Muslims his unsolicited advice, he, however, has no words for the Rajiv Gandhi government, which made the All India Muslim Personal Law Board the “sole representative” of the Muslims in India. Would the AIMPLB have overthrown or challenged the Congress government? Far from it. But still the Congress government chose to do what it did, because it always suited power to impose top-down control on Muslims.

 The history of Indian politics is replete with instances where the Muslim community has been arm twisted by secular parties into silence. But we won’t be blackmailed any more.

 Yes, we are secular. But our fight for secularism will not be decontextualised, we will not operate within frameworks that obfuscate the inequalities and contradictions faced by Muslims. By fighting against the CAA-NRC-NPR, we have begun a fight not just to safeguard secularism but also to ensure social justice. And we shall not stop at simply safeguarding our citizenship. We have the right to be Muslims and still be equal citizens of India.

 This is a moment akin to the Black civil rights movement. We are at the cusp of a possibility. Possibility of being equal again.

1539,0,English,pqr,"Kobe Bryant’s 13-year-old daughter Gianna, who died alongside her father in the helicopter crash that claimed the life of the NBA legend, had shown signs that she could further her father’s glittering basketball legacy.

 Her proud father once said the second-born of the Los Angeles Lakers star’s four daughters with wife Vanessa was “something else” on the basketball court.

 Bryant’s eldest daughter, 17-year-old Natalia, prefers volleyball, Bianka is only three and Capri was only born last year.

 So the 41-year-old NBA great’s basketball hopes were invested in Gianna. “It’s a trip to see her move and the expressions she makes. It’s a trip how genetics work,” Bryant told US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel in 2018.

 “The best thing that happens is when we go out and fans would come up to me and she’ll be standing next to me... and they’ll be like, ‘You’ve gotta have a boy, you and V, gotta have a boy. You gotta have somebody to carry on your tradition, the legacy. She (Gianna) is like, ‘I got this’. I’m like, ‘that’s right’,” he went on. “Yes, you do, you got this.”

 Gianna’s passion for basketball meant she was often pictured sitting alongside her father at games, watching his beloved Lakers at the Staples Center or the WNBA team Los Angeles Sparks.

 She often worked out with her father in the gymnasium of the family’s villa in Newport Beach and he took pride in coaching her high school team when his schedule permitted.

 Gianna was on the helicopter that crashed because she was travelling to a tournament in the Los Angeles suburbs to play for her team, called the Mamba Team, after one of her father’s nicknames.

 One of her teammates was also on board the helicopter and was also among the dead.

 Gianna’s future had already been mapped out – her heart was set on going to Connecticut, the most prestigious women’s basketball program in the US.

 And of course, she had introductions that other young girls players could only dream of – her father’s former agent Rob Pelinka introduced her to basketball stars and coaches.

 Derek Fisher, a Lakers teammate of her father and now coach of the WNBA Sparks, had noticed that Kobe’s steely will to win had rubbed off on Gianna. “They have the similar demeanor and personality,” Fisher said.

 Asked about the reason behind her tears, Dia said the news of basketball legend Kobe Bryants death made her emotional and that she has been upset ever since. Kobe and his 13-year old daughter Gianna were among the nine people killed in a helicopter crash in California on January 26.

 My day started really well yesterday (January 26). At around 3 (early morning), this news alert came on my phone for a very big player, NBA player who I followed for a while. His chopper crashing in California disturbed me. It really upset me. There are different things that upset us on different days, but we take care of ourselves. I was overwhelmed because my blood pressure was low, Dia added.

 The news of Kobe Bryant and his daughters sudden demise sent shockwaves across the world with millions condoling their death. The helicopter crash, meanwhile, is being investigated by local and federal authorities.

 Its a logistical nightmare in a sense because the crash site itself is not easily accessible, Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva was quoted as saying during a news conference by CNN.

Vardy, who has scored 17 goals to fire Leicester into third place in the Premier League this season, injured his glute in a 4-1 home win over West Ham United last week.

 It was feared Vardy would be out for several weeks but Rogers said the forward will be involved at Villa Park after Leicester were held to a 1-1 draw in the first leg. He`s in the squad. He`s worked very hard since his injury last midweek, Rodgers told a news conference on Monday.

 We`ll give him another full day and see how he is tomorrow before we decide whether he starts or comes off the bench. He`ll certainly have a part to play. I think if you ask me if he`s 100%, he maybe 80% but I`d rather have an 80% Jamie Vardy with what he gives the team and the threat. He`s come through the last two days on the field very well and I`m very confident he`ll be involved..

 Rodgers, who won two Scottish Cups and three League Cups during his stint at Celtic, is hoping to guide Leicester to their first cup final in 20 years.

 It`s a wonderful opportunity for us, he added. We`ve just got to stay calm. There`s lots of emotion around these games but you have to play with emotion and calmness and not overthink it. It would be something tangible to show how hard the players have worked.

1546,0,Hindi,xyz,"Despite the several measures taken to revive the real estate sector, both in Budget 2019 and those subsequently announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, sales in the sector grew by a meagre 1 per cent in calendar year 2019, said a report by Knight Frank earlier this month. In comparison, sales in the sector grew 6 per cent in calendar year 2018.

 Some of the key attempts made by the NDA government to bring the sector back to life, especially on residential home sales front, include the setting up of a Rs 25,000 crore alternative investment fund for last-mile funding of stuck affordable housing projects; the rationalising of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates; providing a thrust to affordable housing by allowing taxpayers a deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh against interest paid on home loans taken up to March 31, 2020, for affordable homes valued upto Rs 45 lakh, and; improving liquidity in the non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) segment by allowing banks to have more exposure to the sector and announcing a partial credit guarantee scheme to restore the confidence of shadow banking firms.

 However, these steps have clearly proved inadequate. While a sluggish economy is largely to blame, government interventions in the past few years, such as demonetisation and the implementation of the RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Act) weighed the sector down further. Though touted as clean-up measures, these steps temporarily turned off the liquidity tap to the sector, which was only exacerbated by the NBFCs crisis. As a result, demand has lagged, creating huge inventory overhang. Knight Frank estimates that unsold inventory in eight major cities including Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, Bengaluru and Kolkata, among others, amounted to over 4.45 lakh units by December 2019. Commercial real estate was the only bright spot in an otherwise gloomy picture, with leasing up 56 per cent in 2019 over the previous year.Niranjan Hiranandani, MD of the Hiranandani Group, says that the government should address issues related to liquidity, provide faster clearances to projects and ensure better co-ordination among the multiple regulatory agencies for improved ease of doing business. Gulam Zia, executive director with Knight Frank, says that much of what the government needs to do on the institutional front has already been done. Now, perhaps, it is time to consider ways to put more money in the hands of consumers.

 Also, while much of the attention in previous budgets has been on affordable housing, the focus this time round should be on the segment as a whole, he adds. Apart from the long-lasting demand for industry status to the sector, there should be a focused tax benefit for housing. At present, Section 80 C of the Income Tax Act does not provide for a focused benefit on housing. Tax payers have numerous investment alternatives to choose from and the lack of an exclusive tax benefit on the principal amount of home loans makes them put home purchase decisions on hold, thus impacting sales, says Zia. A separate annual deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh for principal repayment will provide a much-needed fillip for consumers to opt for home loans and therefore provide a fillip to housing sales, he adds. Other measures to be taken include promoting the development of an institutional rental market by providing market creation incentives, and quick and effective implementation of the governments plan to spend over $1 trillion on infrastructure in the next five years. In affordable housing, the government could look at enhancing the eligibility criteria for credit-linked subsidy schemes and GST benefits to help a large section of consumers in urban centres.

 Others, like Ramesh Nair, CEO & Country Head at JLL India, say that an increase in the deduction of interest on home loans for self-occupation from the existing Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3 lakh will benefit buyers in the lower and mid-income category. This is expected to incentivise homebuyers in a scenario of weak demand, he says. Other expectations include extending the sunset clause of Special Economic Zones to be eligible for income tax holidays, from the present deadline of March 31, 2020, a change in income tax slabs in line with the Direct Tax Code, extension of benefits under Section 80EEA to avail additional Rs 1.5 lakh interest deduction on home loans for first time home buyers, and so on. Also mooted by many real estate players is a single-window clearance mechanism that will expedite the approval process for projects.

 Though the Goods and Services Tax (GST) has simplified taxation, it has not led to lower real estate costs. Under-construction homes attract 5 per cent GST for mid-range properties and 1 per cent for affordable homes. However, it does not include input credit benefits, which would have reduced the overall purchase cost. Real estate firms expect these anomalies would be subsequently addressed by the government. Frequent changes in the tax structure, especially relating to GST and service tax, have also taken a significant toll. Beyond GST, stamp duty and registration charges in the 5-7 per cent range apply to under-construction homes. This cumulative cost effectively negates the price advantage they once offered, and the industry looks forward to these being addressed by the finance minister.ALSO READ | Budget expectations: Still reeling from GST, demonetisation, Kanpur manufacturers demand major reformsALSO READ | Ahead of budget, RBI governor underlines need for more structural reforms to revive growthALSO READ | Majority Indians feel pinch of economic slowdown, finds Mood of The Nation 2020 surveyALSO WATCH | India has disappointed on growth and openness story economically: Fareed Zakaria

1548,0,English,pqr,"India Under 19 cricket team clashes with Australia in the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League Quarterfinal at JB Marks Oval in South Africas Potchefstroom at 1:30 pm Indian Standard Time on Tuesday (January 28, 2020). While India topped Group A defeating Sri Lanka (by 90 runs), Japan (by 10 wickets) and New Zealand (44 runs, DLS method), Australia were second-ranked in Group B behind the West Indies. The Australian U19 team lost to the West Indies by three wickets but bounced back to beat Nigeria by 10 wickets and then edged out England by two wickets to book their place in the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League Quarterfinals.

 The two teams between them share seven ICC Cricket World Cup titles with Australia winning the inaugural championship in 1988 followed by triumphs in 2002 and 2010. India, on the other hand, are the most successful team bagging the trophy in 2000, 2008, 2012 and 2018.

 JB Marks Oval pitch is ideal for big scores with an even pace and bounce. The weather in Potchefstroom will be partly sunny but pleasant. There will be some cloud cover but their is no forecast of rain. The maximum temperature will reach 32 degrees Celcius, according to accuweather.com.

 The India U19 vs Australia U19 ICC World Cup Super League Quarterfinal match will be telecast on the Star Sports Network and the live streaming will be on Hotstar.

 One of the most interesting battles in the match will be between two leg spinners - Indias Ravi Bishnoi and Australian Tanveer Sangha. Both the bowlers have taken 10 wickets each in the tournament so far and their form will play a crucial role in their teams performance. Australia do no enjoy a great record against India in the U19 matches since 2013 and have lost four while one match has been rained out. However, the U19 clashes have seen different players taking part in the matches due to the age restrictions.

 Indian batting has been pretty impressive with the opening duo of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Divyansh Saxena along with captain Priyam Garg among the runs. The Indian pacer department too is well served with Kartik Tyagi and Akash Singh troubling the opposition with their pace and line.

 Australian captain Mckenzie Harvey has had a good tournament so far while Conor Sully can trouble the opposing team with his pace bowling as well as batting. Jake Fraser-McGurk, too, can be a big threat with the bat.

 India U19 squad: Priyam Garg (captain), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Divyansh Saxena, Tilak Varma, Dhruv Jurel (wicketkeeper), Siddhesh Veer, Atharva Ankolekar, Ravi Bishnoi, Sushant Mishra, Kartik Tyagi, Akash Singh, Vidyadhar Patil, Shubhang Hegde, Shashwat Rawat, Kumar Kushagra.

 Naila Inayat shared the clip with the caption, One injection is all it takes for the PM to see nurses as hoors. In the hilarious video, Imran Khan can be heard talking about an injury he had sustained, where the bones on his back had broken, because of which the doctor gave him an injection which changed the world for him.

 New Delhi: A fruit seller in Karnataka, Harekala Hajabb, might have never thought of being honoured with any government award leave alone the Padma Shri. But this became reality when the government announced the prestigious Padma Shri Awards for 2020.

 Harekala Hajabb, a resident of Dakshin Kannada, was as surprised as others when he got the news of being conferred with Padam Shri.

 An Indian Forest Service (IFS) officer tweeted about how Hajabb got the information about being honoured by the Padma award.

 Harekala Hajabba was in a line on a ration shop when authorities informed him that he got Padma Shri. This fruit seller from Dakshin Kannada is educating poor children in his village of Newpadapu from a decade in a mosque. Doing all the efforts including spending his savings, tweeted forest officer Parveen Kaswan.

 Kaswan shared the tweet on Sunday and since then it has got over 6,000 likes on Twitter.

 According to a BBC report, Hajabbs Newpadpu village, about 350 kilometres from state capital Bengaluru, did not have any school. In 2000, Hajabb decided to set up a school with his meagre income. The fruit seller even availed loans to buy land for the school. Hajabba started his school at a local mosque which housed a madrasa with 28 students.

 Hajabba, who himself is unlettered, said he was prompted to set up the school after an encounter with a foreigner. I felt very helpless when a foreigner asked me about the price of fruits in English. I was unable to comprehend what he meant, the 55-year-old Padma award winner told BBC.

 And that was the day when Hajabba decided to start school. The school set up by the fruit seller now houses 130 students. He now plans to set up a college.

 Mumbai: As the voices against the Citizenship Amendment Act continue to gather momentum across India, especially in states that are not ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, the state of Maharashtra has not yet moved a resolution opposing the law, though the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party are in power in the coalition government.

 The Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister claimed said that anti-CAA resolutions could have been passed in Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal since they are single-party ruled states, but Maharashtra is not.

 “States like Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal have passed resolutions against Citizenship (Amendment) Act. They are ruled by one party, unlike Maharashtra. Our Chief Minister (Uddhav Thackeray) said there should be no problem for anyone in the State due to CAA and NRC. We are of this opinion,” news agency ANI quoted Pawar as saying on Monday.

 The West Bengal Legislative Assembly had yesterday passed a resolution against the citizenship law in the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress-ruled state.

 The states of Kerala, Punjab and Rajasthan had earlier passed resolutions against the Citizenship Amendment Act. The WB Assembly had last year on September 6 passed another resolution against the National Register of Citizens, the Centre’s bid to flush out illegal immigrants.

 As per the central government, the CAA intends to grant citizenship to refugees belonging to the Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Parsi communities who fled religious persecution in neighbouring countries of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and entered India till 31 December 2014.

 Bhatt was among a host of noted personalties who spoke at a conference organised in the backdrop of the ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

 The event in Colaba, south Mumbai, was organised by the Parcham Foundation and We the People of Maharashtra.

 Speakers later submitted a memorandum to government representatives, seeking to know the stand of state authorities on the CAA-NRC-NPR within 30 days.

 Bhatt said “Our silence will not save us and neither will the government’s. The ruling party has actually united us.

 “Students (protesting against CAA-NRC) are giving us the message that it’s time to raise our voices. We will not stop until we are heard loud and clear. Dissent is the greatest form of patriotism.”

 The aim of the conference was to discuss the need to preserve and safeguard the values of the Constitution and educate the masses about them, its organisers said.

 Student activist Umar Khalid said, “We request the government to accept our memorandum. We are seeing a shift in the stance of the Shiv Sena but if it is a real shift then we need to see that in action.

 “We have declared a satyagraha. Now the ball is in the government’s court. Will they join us or stay aloof?”

 IPS officer Abdur Rahman, who has resigned from service over the CAA-NRC, said “Every movement has heroes and heroes of this one (anti-CAA protests) are women.

 “The government has many women representatives but no one has come to meet any of the protesting women. We have the right to protest peacefully and democratically. Police need to learn to defend laws and allow protests to take place.”

 Rahman said, “It (the CAA) is a coloured legislation.

 There is no refugee crisis in India. It is being manufactured to divide us.”

 Businessman-politician Farhan Azmi said, “We will ensure this law is taken back. The more the government hates us, the more we will love them. Such conferences will continue.

1561,0,English,pqr,"Hyderabad, The ruling TRS in Telangana, which swept the Urban Local Body (ULB) polls held last week, on Monday bagged the Mayor or Chairman posts in more than 100 ULBs of the total 120 municipalities and nine Corporations.

 The election to the posts of Mayor or Municipal Chairman and Vice Chairman or Deputy Mayor led a to war of words between the TRS and the Congress, BJP with the ruling party and opposition accusing each other of adopting unethical practices to secure the top posts in the urban local bodies.

 While the TRS bagged more than 100 ULBs, Congress managed to win only four municipalities, while the BJP and AIMIM got two each, according to official information on Monday night.

 TRS working president K T Rama Rao said his party was miles ahead of the opposition as it bagged 119 of the 127 ULBs.

 The indirect election to the top posts in ULBs has been postponed in two municipalities.

 He alleged that the opposition Congress and BJP reached an understanding at many places to get the chairman and vice chairman posts.

 Citing some examples, he alleged that while chairman post went to one party, the vice chairman post was taken by the other.

 Thanking the voters for the landslide victory, he said the TRS government would make sincere efforts for the fulfillment of promises made by his party in the polls.

 Birth and death certificates besides land use certificates would be provided online in municipalities, he said.

 Building construction approval process, which has earned notoriety, would be corrected, he asserted.

 Training would be provided to town planning personnel and the government would not hesitate to dismiss them from service for lapses on their part, he said, adding it would be tough towards illegal layouts by real estate developers.

 Meanwhile, state BJP president K Laxman alleged that the TRS adopted unethical means to win the municipal posts.

 He alleged that the TRS government adopted undemocratic means in the matter of MPs and others, who have ex-officio powers, participating in the indirect election.

 Former Congress MP Madhu Yashki Goud alleged that ex- officio members have been given choice against the spirit of people’s verdict.

 Rama Rao, however, said the party used its options as per rules.

 The Renault Triber has just been updated to meet the stricter BS6 emission norms, with prices now starting at Rs 4.99 lakh. While the entry-level model’s price has increased by Rs 4,000, the top-spec Triber RxZ variant now costs Rs 29,000 more than its BS4 counterpart. We have compiled the variant-wise price break-up below:

 The Triber uses a BS6-compliant version of the 1.0-litre, three-cylinder petrol engine, which produces 72hp and 96Nm of torque. The engine is offered with a sole 5-speed manual gearbox option. In BS4 form, the Triber had an ARAI fuel efficiency figure of 20kpl. It’ll be interesting to see if that changes.

 There have been no changes to its features list as top-spec Tribers continue to get an 8.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support, a digital instrument cluster, AC vents in all three rows, a cooled centre box, keyless entry, push-button start/stop, power windows, projector headlamps with LED DRLs and more.

 In terms of safety, all Tribers come with three-point seat belts on all rows, ABS, reverse parking sensors and at least two airbags. Additionally, top-spec variants get the added safety of front-side airbags and a rear parking camera.

 As we had previously reported, the Triber will also get a 1.0-litre turbo-petrol engine option by March 2020. Renault is also working on an AMT automatic gearbox option for the Triber.

 A historic Accord was signed on Monday through discussions with all the factions of the NDFB. The Centre and state government want peace in the region through dialogue, Sarma said, referring to the Bodo pact.

 Most of the militant outfits in the northeastern states, barring some in Assam and Manipur, are holding talks but if we want peace in the region, it should be inclusive by involving all the factions and the outfits, he said.

 The offer comes a few days after ULFA(I) claimed responsibility for four serial blasts in Upper Assam districts on the Republic Day.

 The BJP MP openly threatened Shaheen Bagh protesters as he addressed a rally in west Delhis Ranhoula village under Vikaspuri assembly on January 27. Verma said if the BJP is voted to power in Delhi, it will only take an hour to clear off protests in Shaheen Bagh.

 This election [Delhi poll] is not a small election but that for stability and unity of the country. If a government of the Bharatiya Janata Party is formed on the February 11, then after an hour no one will be seen in Shaheen Bagh, said West Delhi BJP MP Parvesh Verma.

 Verma added that within one month all existing mosques built on government land in his constituency will be demolished if the Bharatiya Janata Party comes to power in Delhi this year.

 On January 27, BJP leader and Union minister Anurag Thakur sparked a row after he egged on participants of an election rally to raise an incendiary slogan that traitors should be shot, as he lashed out at anti-CAA protestors.

 At the rally, the minister of state for finance, shouted desh ke gaddaron ko to which the crowd responded goli maro sa*** ko (shoot down the traitors).

 The controversial slogan has been raised by some junior BJP leaders of late, including Kapil Mishra, but this is the first time a party functionary of the level of a Union minister has participated in it. Thakur is also heard telling the crowd to raising the slogan in such a high voice that Giriraj Singh, a firebrand Hindutva leader and a Union minister, can hear it.

 The incident has triggered a row, drawing a sharp reaction from the following which the Delhis Chief Electoral Officer sought a report from the returning officer of Rithala constituency over Thakurs speech.

 Tokyo: Byte, a new video-sharing app released Friday to compete with ByteDance Inc.’s TikTok, has rocketed to the top of Apple Inc.’s U.S. App Store.

 Created by Dom Hofmann, Byte reboots the deprecated Vine video-sharing service, which he co-founded in the summer of 2012 and sold to Twitter Inc. later that year. The parent company failed to find a way to make the service profitable and eventually discontinued it in 2016. Despite its brief existence, Vine became a cultural touchpoint in the U.S., with many users embracing its six-second time limit as a creative challenge. It was where controversial YouTube star Logan Paul, whose channel now has more than 20 million subscribers, got his start.

 Byte “ended Friday as the No. 1 free iPhone app on the U.S. App Store and is still in the top spot,” said Randy Nelson of research firm Sensor Tower. Beside the U.S., Byte is also the top free iOS app in Canada and ranks in the top 10 in Australia, New Zealand, Norway and the U.K. On Android’s Play Store, Byte is sixth among free apps in the U.S.

 The new app was downloaded more than 780,000 times over the weekend, with three quarters of those installs coming from the U.S., Sensor Tower estimated on Monday.

 The timing of Byte’s release coincides with a moment of reckoning for TikTok and its Beijing-based parent company. ByteDance is looking to hire a chief executive officer for TikTok, which is under increasing scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers wary about the influence of Chinese companies on American consumers. TikTok’s runaway popularity has been deemed to create “national security risks,” according to a letter by Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton in the fall.

 Unlike ByteDance, which is the world’s highest-valued startup, and most other social media contenders, Byte is starting off small and its community guidelines make several references to the company’s modest budget. Still, the strong early response to Byte’s arrival — coming with little to no advance fanfare — suggests the community that Vine built up remains loyal to the particular six-second format. Some of the early popular videos on the platform are humorous proclamations of “Don’t post TikToks here.”

So far, no one has tested positive. We had sent six samples to the virology lab in Pune, but all of them tested negative. Tomorrow, we are sending a few more samples,’’ official said.

 Stating that the situation is under control at present, the official said, “We have to be realistic, especially after a positive case was confirmed in Nepal. We fear such a possibility and the department is fully prepared to meet such an eventuality,” he said.

 Health department sources said a major chunk of those who have been put under observation was directly picked up from airports after they returned from China. “They are students and business travellers. A section of them have reported at hospitals days after landing in Kerala following the alert issued by the health department.’’

 The health department has arranged isolation wards in all 14 districts. Those under home quarantine would be monitored by the primary health centres in the region. They would be under watch for 28 days. Health staff would be in touch with them at regular intervals on a day.

 Meanwhile, a Mumbai resident and two Pune residents have been put under quarantine and their samples have been sent for testing. All the three recently returned from China.

 The first suspected case of a coronavirus infection in Punjab was reported from Mohali on Monday. The man, who returned from China a week ago, has been referred to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.

 Weight loss through exercises is very beneficial. Read on to know more about the benefits of losing weight through exercise.

 Any amount of exercise done at age is always beneficial for the body. If you are obese or overweight, you need to take measures whereby you can attain your ideal weight as soon as possible. Exercise is a great way to lose the extra kilos. An adequate amount of physical activity as suggested by fitness experts can not only boost your metabolism and keep you fit, but aid fat loss keeping the valuable muscle mass intact. According to various researches, there are several other associated benefits when you lose weight through exercise:

 Ward off Heart Ailments

 Regular physical exercise enhances the strength of your heart muscles, brings down blood pressure, improves circulation and helps the heart to function efficiently. It also results in the fall of ‘bad’ cholesterol, the LDLs or low density lipoproteins, and raises the levels of the ‘good’ cholesterol, the HDLs high density lipoproteins.

 Each of the above-mentioned aspects effectively brings down the risks of stroke and other heart diseases. There are innumerable studies that indicate that an adequate amount of regular physical activity allays the probability of the individual dying from a heart stroke.

 Reduces the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

 According to medical experts, type 2 diabetes is fast emerging as a global epidemic. Stressful lives and sedentary lifestyle are the main factors that induce this disease. The risk increases manifold when you are already overweight. Weight loss through regular exercise can not only effectively fight this problem but also help you fight against the predominant factors that are known to cause this disease.

 Your insulin sensitivity will increase when you work out regularly and thereby improve your blood sugar and cholesterol levels. It will also bring down your blood pressure and each of the factors will help you prevent and fight diabetes.

 Fight Obesity

 Obesity is an escalation of being overweight. You can successfully prevent this through regular exercise. Besides if you are already obese, you can bring down your weight and look forward to living a healthy and fit life once you begin to follow your regular exercise regimen.

 An adequate amount of activity will result in the reduction of body fat, while taking care of your muscle mass. This will improve your body’s ability to burn off the extra calories. Apart from following a healthy diet, it is important to control obesity through regular exercise as obesity can give rise to a series of serious associated ailments.

 Relief from Pains and Osteoporosis

 Regular exercise can effectively manage and prevent several muscle pains like those in the joints and back. When you regularly workout your muscles, they become more flexible and strong. This can effectively reduce such joint and back pains.

 Osteoporosis happens due to the weakness of the bones and regular physical activity is helpful in strengthening the bone formation. Vitamin D and calcium rich diet along with the required exercise is a great way to obtain relief from osteoporosis pain and even prevent the disease from occurring in women after they reach their menopause.

 The popularity of Indian food is soaring in all corners of the world; perhaps due to its versatility and a broad range of tastes. There is another reason to it – the dietary factor. If you compare Indian food with the other popular ones, the American food, people prefer to acknowledge that Indian diet is a far healthier one.

 The practice of preferring home-cooked food by Indians is gaining appreciation for its health benefits. The staple Indian diet constitutes of rice, whole wheat breads, and lots of veggies, fish, meat, poultry and dairy products. This entails a more or less balanced diet. Thereby it can be concluded that if you want to lose weight, you can opt for Indian style diet as well.

 Factors Inducing Weight Loss in Indian Diet

 Here are some of the factors that induce weight loss in Indian diet.

 Most Ingredients are Low Fat – Most of the Indian dishes are made from rice, legumes and vegetables, which are healthy and help with weight loss. The method of making bread in the Indian style is a lot different from the manner of baking bread in the European style. Even the method in which Indian breads are baked, like rotis, tandoori rotis and tandoori naans are a much healthier option than the buttered batter used for baking garlic breads or cakes. And if the fat inducing elements like ghee and oil are used sparingly or avoided, your weight loss regimen would be even more readily upheld.

 Spices are Used Instead of Oils – In most European and American cooking, various types of oils are used for dressing and brushing the baking ingredient. But in Indian foods, spices play a big role in inducing taste of the food. For weight loss, one can easily opt to steam the food instead of frying it in oil, and still manage to retain the taste as well as the flavour of the dish. Not to forget how it can benefit your health. Besides most spices, like fennel seeds, clove and cardamom have a lot of digestive properties as well, and they are commonly used in Indian dishes.

 High in Fiber – Legumes and grains are some very common ingredients of Indian food. Now, legumes, whole grains, beans are great protein sources and good choice for people who are interested in effective weight loss. Since these types of foods are high in fiber content, it induces the feeling of fullness and satisfaction readily. So you eat lesser in comparison to what you would have had if you opted for those that are high in fat or empty calories. Thus a high fiber diet induces weight loss, while ensuring that the requirements of daily nutrition are met. Besides these foods have added vitamins and helps in burning body fat more readily.

 Finally, some simple changes in cooking method can actually go a long way in ensuring that the calorie content is kept to the minimum. The tandoor and ‘dum’ method of cooking not only ensures great taste to both veg and non-veg food, but also makes it fat free and high in nutrients. The commonly served fluids like dal, coconut water, chaans, or butter milk are not only nutritious but also effective in improving the digestive system and curb the possibility of piling on extra servings during the main course. Besides, the little oil that is used in Indian food is good for the body as a complete cut-back on oils can affect the hormonal balance in our system.

1573,0,Hindi,abc,"Since we were young, we have been taught that there are certain topics on which we can’t talk publicly. Discussing those topics even with our parents and elders was considered wrong and we were guided to keep our thoughts on those topics shut. Topics like same-sex marriage, rape, domestic violence, and mensuration were considered bad to discuss in public and in front of elders and parents. But now as the country is moving towards being a ‘developed’ country, people have started adapting to the changes that have come from the west and their mindset is also changing. They have started talking about all the above-mentioned topics with their kids so that they can understand what is right and what is wrong. School textbooks have also included these topics in their curriculum. Though we are yet to achieve a lot in terms of being open about such topics, these small changes are worth appreciating. (Recommended Read: Ravi Dubey And Sargun Mehta Welcome Home A Brand New Car, The Former Pens A Happy Note)

 Some credit for this needs to be given to Bollywood for bringing a lot of change in the mindset of the people. A shift from masala entertainment scripts to unconventional scripts has made a lot of difference in the mindset of the people. From movies based on domestic violence to rape victims, we are progressing towards a better understanding of various topics and the ones who are getting more influenced by these are the millennials. Ayushmann Khurrana is one such actor, who from the beginning of his career has been doing concept-based films and has received a lot of applause. He will next be seen in the movie, Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan which is based upon same-sex marriage. He has already received a lot of applause for choosing a film based on such a bold topic.

 On January 27, 2020, Ayushmann Khurrana’s wife, Tahira Kashyap took to her Twitter handle and shared an incident which left her teary-eyed. She shared the conversation she had with her 8-year-old son, Virajveer on his father, Ayushmann’s upcoming movie. Her tweet could be read as “With the upcoming film the dad is doing, I wanted to be forthcoming with my 8-year-old son. I asked him if he knows what homosexuality means or being gay means. He knew it. I asked him if he was ok with it. He replied...what’s there not be ok about. (Teary-eyed and proud)”

 Tahira Kashyap recently attended an event at TATA memorial hospital in Mumbai with breast cancer patients and was all praises for her husband, Ayushmann Khurrana for taking up a movie on such a bold topic. She had said, “I am proud of the films that he (Ayushmann) is doing, and even this one. I feel the idea is to celebrate love, and the day we stop thinking and about whether its a love story between a boy and a boy, or between a girl and a girl, we will have developed as a nation. It is important to be in love irrespective of gender and I am happy that he did this film.” (Suggested Read: Smriti Irani Pens A Cute Note For BFF, Ekta Kapoors Son, Ravie Kapoors 1st Birthday)

 In an interview with the ANI, Ayushmann Khurrana had revealed the reaction of his parents after watching the trailer of the movie, Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan. Ayushmann is the first leading hero to portray the role of a gay man on the big screen. Talking about his parent’s reaction, he had said, “When I showed them (parents) the trailer of the film, they absolutely loved it. They saw it on loop and laughed all the way through. I was thrilled with this reaction from them because I realized immediately that the subject, my character has appealed and connected with them.”

 Ayushmann, during the same interview, had revealed how his parents were in full support of him taking an important film with a strong message and had said, “I always talk to my parents about the films that I decide to do and I got tremendous support from them when I told them that I’m going to do Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan. They said they were proud of me that I decided to back a film that had a strong message to society. They said it was an important film for the entire country especially the parents because it could give them the right message about raising their children.”

 Earlier, in an interview with Anupama Chopra, Tahira had talked about her insecurities when Ayushmann entered Bollywood. She had revealed, “I was this crazy, insecure pregnant person when Vicky Donor happened and that was the worst phase for both of us. I think both of us were very immature. He didn’t have the maturity to kind of hold my hand and tell me it’s ok, especially, when I am crazy on my hormones because I was pregnant at the time and I also didn’t have the maturity to just take it easy and know this thing will get over.

1574,0,English,abc,"Researchers have found that there is no male advantage in mental rotation abilities associated with spatial cognition competences, by employing cutting-edge eye-tracking technology. The study was conducted by researchers at Lero, the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Software, University of Limerick (UL), Ireland. It was published in the journal Scientific Reports. Dr. Campbell said the skill of spatial cognition or our ability to navigate our environment has been the battleground for almost 40 years for researchers claiming that males have a distinct performance advantage on tests of spatial cognition, notably the mental rotations test. Studying the cognitive proficiency of individuals and gamers is a key aim of the Lero Esports Science Research Lab which opened in 2019 and is the first of its kind in Ireland. “Better performance on these tests is strongly associated with higher IQ and better performance in STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Maths) subjects in schools and colleges,” Dr. Campbell explained.

 Dr. Toth sums up the results: “So males are better than females? Well no, actually. Our study found that there is no male advantage in mental rotation abilities. By lengthening the time allowed to complete the test, the male performance advantage diminished entirely suggesting that the so-called sex difference in mental rotation is simply not there or maybe explained by other factors.”

 The research also found for the first time that both males and females frequently employed different gaze strategies during the cognitive tests to get to the correct answer. In other words, men and women approach the task in a different way to get the same result.

 One hundred University of Limerick (UL) undergraduate and postgraduate level psychology and sports science students volunteered to take part in the test carried out by the Lero researchers. The 47 men and 53 women were in good health and had an average age of 23.

 The word for history, itihasa, literally means ‘this is what happened’. ‘Thus it was’,” begins Jairam Ramesh. “And when I write political biographies, this word is what I follow. Because history doesn’t lend itself to binary interpretations, it is complex. So as a biographer, it’s my job to be clinical, precise, and be a narrative biographer instead of passing judgment.”

 This is, perhaps, the only way to do justice to a biography of as complicated a historical figure as V.K. Krishna Menon. The diplomat who spent decades in London negotiating fiercely for Indian independence; the three-time Member of Parliament representing constituencies as diverse as Trivandrum, Midnapore and North Bombay (as they were then); the orator par excellence who, in 1957, delivered the longest speech until then at the United Nations (eight hours over two days, after which he fainted); a founding editor of Penguin’s Pelican imprint; an abrasive, acerbic man and Jawaharlal Nehru’s political soulmate — Menon was many things. But he is also, and perhaps most instantly, remembered for the debacle of 1962, when, under his watch as minister of defence, India was roundly defeated in war by China. This is also why the title of Ramesh’s biography of him, A Chequered Brilliance: The Many Lives of Krishna Menon, is a fitting one.

 At the fifth edition of the Kerala Literature Festival on Kozhikode Beach (in the same city where Menon was born, in fact), Jairam Ramesh speaks to ThePrint about why he wrote this book, the art of being a politician and writing a political biography, the importance of Krishna Menon in Indian political history, and why he supports but stays away from the protests sweeping across India.

 “One major reason [I was keen to write about Menon] is the availability of primary archival material. I’m willing to write a book on anyone as long as there is mountains of primary material. Second, he was a very complex personality, but also very important, both pre- and post-1947. And any student of political history needs to know and has to contend with this personality,” explains Ramesh.

 Why was he so important, when, for 30 years, Menon wasn’t even here? He was in London and came back to India only in 1953, and there was a lot of resentment among freedom fighters in India that Nehru gave Menon so much importance — people felt that he had not suffered or sacrificed as they had, he had not protested and been lathi-charged, he had not gone to jail.

 “We are all taught in school that Indian Independence was the product of a revolutionary non-violent upheaval led by Gandhi and fought in India, and that’s true to some extent, but there was a whole other kind of freedom struggle going on in London and other parts of England, decades of negotiations and back-channel dialogues with the Labour Party, Round Table Conferences, talks with Clement Attlee and Stafford Cripps and the likes — and Krishna Menon was leading all of that. Because Nehru was the international face of the Indian National Congress and Menon was Nehru’s man, he was key to this process.”

 Also read: Bumbling Nehru, paranoid Menon, divided Army — stunning tales from India’s military history

 There are so many people in our freedom movement waiting to be excavated, says Ramesh. “Menon is better known than some, but there’s still so much people don’t know. For example, today at anti-CAA/NRC protests across India, everyone is reading and reading aloud the Constitution, the Preamble. To a large extent, the Preamble and the idea of a Constituent Assembly came from Menon.

 “From 1934 onwards, Menon was bombarding Nehru with ideas on these. Gandhi, in fact was initially not in favour, and it was only in the late 1930s that he came around. We don’t know all of this about Menon because the defeat to China in 1962 clouds everything else.”

 Ramesh believes our view of 1962 is blinkered by the fact that “the first books that came out about it were by Army officers — Brigadier John Dalvi’s Himalayan Blunder and others. But it’s clear that there was a collapse of military leadership, the Army top brass was infighting and playing its own games.”

 He continues, “In July of 1962, five months before the Chinese invasion, Thimayya wrote an article in Seminar saying that war with China was inconceivable, and that the only way to solve the Chinese problem was through diplomacy — exactly Menon’s position as well.”

 How does one politician write about another, from his own party, without bias? “In all my three biographies so far [he’s done one on Indira Gandhi and one on P.N. Haksar], I have used a narrative tone, and primary archival material — letters, newspapers, official documents. No oral history, no recollections, no interviews. It’s also important to keep your distance from the subject. Most biographers either love or hate their subject, they either do love jobs or hit jobs, and that’s not a good biography.”

 There are some political biographers whom Ramesh is a fan of. “There’s Sarvepalli Gopal, who has written biographies of Nehru and of his father (Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan); Rajmohan Gandhi, who wrote on Rajaji, Gandhi and Patel; Ramachandra Guha now. Robert Caro, an American biographer of Lyndon Johnson, is meticulous in terms of his devotion to detail and archival material. And Roy Jenkins, former British Labour Party MP who has written a number of political biographies. I’m in the Caro mould in terms of substance, and Jenkins in style.”

 It is difficult, he admits. But he is also clear he is not writing as a Congressman, but as a student of history. “If I was writing as a Congressman, I would not have been critical of the Emergency in the Indira Gandhi book. I wouldn’t have been critical of Nehru and Menon’s roles in 1962 in this book.”

 Also read: Was Krishna Menon thinking of a coup against Nehru? COAS Gen Thimayya had privately said this

 The book relies so heavily on correspondence — letters between Menon and his sisters, Menon and Nehru, later Indira, and even correspondence about Menon — that it is, in many ways, an epistolary novel. Ramesh agrees, adding that this book would not have been possible in today’s times because no one writes those volumes of letters.

 “You see, this was a generation of letter writers. Someone came to me once asking if I’d write a biography of Vajpayee, and I asked, do you have any primary material? They didn’t, because it’s a different generation,” he says.

 From womb to tomb, this book took Ramesh about 15 months, including the research and the writing. It was the research that took time, he says. He likens his writing process to the Brownian motion, a physics term that describes the erratic movement of particles, with no structure or sequence.

 “I don’t wait for all the material. I get what I think is the crux of the research material and I start writing. Then I see the gaps and go out and try to fill them. I don’t have a structure, a table of contents or summary to begin with.”

 That also means that while researching and writing, Ramesh himself discovered many things about Menon and his life, came across many surprises. For example, while Menon is deified in his birthplace and the wider state of Kerala, Ramesh was shocked to learn that he actually opposed the creation of Kerala in 1956.

 “He wrote to Nehru in 1955 saying that the creation of Kerala would be dangerous as the state would emerge as a bastion of the Reds. He was also opposed to the creation of an independent Madras, as he felt that would become a bastion of separatism and linguistic fanaticism. His rather romantic view was to have a Dakshin Pradesh instead — with parts of all the four southern states. Also, Menon didn’t speak Malayalam at all! He won three elections after having campaigned entirely in English — we can’t imagine that today.”

 Another interesting thing he found was that it was in 1959 that Article 356 was used for the first time.

 “Nehru used it to dismiss Namboodiripad’s government — and Menon didn’t oppose it. His family owned a large plot of land, and he and they were very worried about the loss of land in a Communist government, despite his own somewhat Communist leanings. So, he isn’t a character one can pin down easily or put in a box. In fact, one of his sisters wrote to Nehru asking for assurance that their land would not be taken away — and Nehru patiently wrote back to her as well,” Ramesh chuckles.

 “He would not be who he was without the women in his life,” says Ramesh, “especially his first mentor in life, Annie Besant. Then, there was his eldest sister Chinnamalu Amma, a firebrand feminist and polyglot who wrote articles on feminist issues in the 1910s, and wrote an article in 1948 supporting Sheikh Abdullah, well before Menon’s own marathon speech at the UN on Kashmir.

 Another sister, Janaki Amma, was his lifelong confidant and emotional support, incredibly talented, an excellent swimmer and shooter, and in fact, he executed the power of attorney in her name when their father passed away. He was also very close to Indira Gandhi — it was an ‘Indu’-‘Krishna’ type of relationship despite the fact that he was so much older.”

 Ramesh believes Kerala’s society is paradoxical like that — female literacy is the highest, gender empowerment is highest, “but it is only Kerala’s men that have been the focus of its literature, talented women have never got their due. In Menon’s case, I’ve tried to bring out the importance of these women”.

 This brings us to the role of women in today’s times, particularly the protests across India, which are being led from the front by women.

 “Yes! You see, I think women understand oppression better than men — that could be partly why they’ve come out in such numbers. Also, it’s not so much the CAA as the NRC combined with it. People have seen what happened in Assam, people have recognised what’s going on.

 “We should applaud protesters, but I do believe we should maintain an arm’s-length relationship. Despite pressure from my sons, especially my younger son, I have refused to go to JNU or any protests — not because of anything else, but it’s not right to go and become the story. I would go as a citizen, not as a Congress party member or MP, but that is what it would look like. I have a life outside politics but it would get overshadowed.

 “Protests must remain spontaneous, loose and unstructured, and they should not be contaminated by the virus of political parties. I’m glad that people have resisted political parties this time. I have consistently been saying parties have to fight their political battles in Parliament and in courts, but people’s protests should be left to them.”

 Ramesh isn’t one to sit idle. He’s already looking at his next project — about an 1879 book called The Light of Asia by Edwin Arnold. “It explores how Indians look at Buddha, what we think of Buddha as a man, Buddha the compassionate human being. This book profoundly influenced Tagore, Gandhi, Nehru and Ambedkar; it played a huge role in the social justice movement and was translated into multiple Indian languages: Gujarati, Tamil, Punjabi, Malayalam, Marathi, Assamese, Sindhi and more. I’ve got a lot of material, so I want to look at why this book was so influential.”

 So, what does Jairam Ramesh do for fun? He laughs at the thought. “I wish I could read for fun, but most of my reading is on political history and economics. I don’t watch movies, but I’ve become a big Netflix addict — my older son is aghast at this,” he grins. “I loved Wild Wild Country, Ken Burns’ The Vietnam War series, and oh, I loved The Irishman!”

 He loves documentaries and biopics, but believes that creating one on someone who is still living or active is odd.

 “Even this book of mine on Menon would not have been possible for me 20 years ago. My job was also to write a history of India via writing about Menon, and you have to allow for a bit of time and perspective to do justice to it,” Ramesh says.

1577,0,English,pqr,"New Delhi: One of India’s most celebrated freedom fighters, Lala Lajpat Rai also known as ‘Punjab Kesari’, played an important role in the Independence movement. He was born on January 28, 1865 in Ferozpur and Tuesday marks the 155th birth anniversary of the great leader.

 During India’s independence movement, Rai was a prominent member of the famous ‘Lal Bal Pal’ firebrand trio, which included Bal Gangadhar Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal.

 He had advocated the Swadeshi movement in India and called for boycott of all imported goods and the use of Indian made goods. Along with this, Lalaji was also associated with the Punjab National Bank and Lakshmi Insurance Company in the 1980s.

 A prolific writer, leader, politician and activist, Rai died from a heart attack on November 17, 1928 after not recovering from injuries received during a police lathi-charge, while protesting the arrival of Simon Commission.

 PM Modi pays tributes

 Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday paid tributes to him on his birth anniversary, saying his sacrifice will continue to inspire Indians.

 मां भारती के वीर सपूत पंजाब केसरी लाला लाजपत राय को उनकी जयंती पर शत-शत नमन। देश की आजादी के लिए प्राण न्योछावर करने की उनकी गाथा देशवासियों को सदैव प्रेरित करती रहेगी।— Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) January 28, 2020

 “Salute to the brave son of mother India, Punjab Kesari Lala Lajpat Rai on his birth anniversary. His sacrifice for the independence of the country will always inspire the countrymen,” Prime Minister wrote on Twitter.

 All you need to know about him:

 Lala Lajpat Rai was born on January 28, 1865 to Munshi Radha Krishna Azad and Gulab Devi at Dhudike village in Ferozpur District. Lala’s father, Munshi Azad was a scholar of Persian and Urdu while his mother was a religious lady who inculcated strong moral values in her children.

 Lala Lajpat Rai was deeply influenced by the ideals of patriotism and nationalism outlined by Italian revolutionary leader Giuseppe Mazzini. He earned the ‘Punjab Kesari’ title which means the Lion of the Punjab for his fierce brand of patriotism and vocalism against the British rule in India.

 On October 30, 1928, he led a peaceful procession to oppose the arrival of the Simon Commission in Lahore during which he badly injured in police lathi-charge. Lala Lajpat Rai’s death anniversary, 17 November, is one of the several days celebrated as Martyrs’ Day in India.

 He was one of the architects of the Swadeshi movement along with Mahatma Gandhi, Aurobindo Ghosh, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal and others.

 In 1897, he founded the Hindu Orphan Relief Movement to keep the Christian missions from securing custody of these children. Several famous books that Lala Lajpat Rai penned are The Story of My Deportation (1908), Arya Samaj (1915), The United States of America: A Hindu’s impressions (1916), Young India (1916), England’s Debt to India: India (1917).

 Quotes by the great leader

 1. I declare that the blows struck at me will be the last nails in the coffin of the British rule in India.

 2. If I had the power to influence Indian journals, I would have the following headlines printed in bold letters on the first page: Milk for the infants, Food for the adults and Education for all.

 3. The Government which attacks its own innocent subjects has no claim to be called a civilised government. Bear in mind, such a government does not survive long.

 4. Since the cruel killing of cows and other animal have commenced, I have anxiety for the future generation.

 5. I always believed that my silence on several topics will be an advantage in the long run.

 Neither uttered the other’s name. But President Donald Trump and Swedish climate campaigner Greta Thunberg took unmistakable aim at each other Tuesday at this conference of business and government figures, reprising their roles as antagonists on the global stage.

 The 73-year-old president and 17-year-old activist dominated the first full day of the gathering, painting starkly different visions of the future, and staking out opposite poles on the signature theme of this year’s forum: how best to manage a world of increasing temperatures, rising seas and catastrophic wildfires.

 Trump implicitly criticized Thunberg and other activists, saying they peddled warnings of doom at a time when his policies had ushered in a bright new era of economic prosperity for Americans.

 “They are the heirs of yesterday’s foolish fortunetellers,” the president said. “They predicted an overpopulation crisis in the 1960s, a mass starvation in the 70s, and an end of oil in the 1990s.”

 “This is not a time for pessimism,” Trump declared, adding, “Fear and doubt is not a good thought process.”

 Thunberg listened, sitting with three other climate activists in the sixth row.

 An hour later, Thunberg, addressing another Davos audience, rebuked leaders for failing to fix a problem of their own making. She said they had ignored pleas for the world to act on climate change. And she flatly rejected Trump’s assertion that there was much to be optimistic about.

 “You say children shouldn’t worry,” Thunberg said. “You say, ‘Just leave this to us. We will fix this. We promise we won’t let you down.’ ”

 Then, a line that did not appear in her prepared remarks: “‘Don’t be so pessimistic.’”

 The last time the two encountered each other, at the United Nations in September, she glared as she watched him pass before her in the General Assembly building. Photos and video of her expression spread widely, only to be followed by what was widely seen as a sarcastic Twitter message from the president.

 “She seems like a very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,” he wrote. “So nice to see!”

 Thunberg struck back immediately with her nearly 2 million Twitter followers, briefly changing her bio: “A very happy young girl looking forward to a bright and wonderful future,” she wrote.

 There was nothing so direct Tuesday, when Trump and Thunberg spoke to separate audiences.

 Trump celebrated his deregulatory agenda, which he said had unshackled the American economy, allowing the United States to build profitable new energy businesses and to wean itself from energy dependence on what he labeled hostile countries.

 Trump’s impact on environmental protections has been wide-ranging. He has withdrawn from the Paris climate accord, rolled back a wide range of emissions regulations and empowered a bureaucracy that has sought to undermine the science of climate change.

 The United States is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases in history.

 President Donald Trump delivers opening remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on 21 Jan 2020. Image: Anna Moneymaker/NYT

 The closest Trump’s speech at Davos came to environmental issues was his claim that the United States had the cleanest air and drinking water on Earth. In fact, the Trump administration has pushed through a plan to weaken clean-water regulations. And air pollution in the United States has worsened since 2016, reversing decades of improvements, according to researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.

 Trump dismissed the activists as advocating a form of “radical socialism” that Americans would reject. While he got only perfunctory applause, his message resonated with some in the business-heavy audience.

 Critics pointed to a contradiction that they said the corporate world had been unable to resolve: how to assuage the appetite for economic growth, based on gross domestic product, with the urgent need to check carbon emissions.

 “It’s truly a contradiction,” said Johan Rockström, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research. “It’s difficult to see if the current GDP-based model of economic growth can go hand-in-hand with rapid cutting of emissions,” he said.

 Thunberg, for her part, largely repeated the warning she issued at the United Nations last year and for which she has drawn widespread global attention.

 She spent several weeks in the United States, joining school climate strikes, visiting Native American activists at the Standing Rock Sioux reservation, which covers parts of North and South Dakota, and testifying in Congress. There, when asked to submit her remarks, she opted instead to submit a report issued in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change spelling out the threats of global temperature rise.

 Thunberg has always maintained that she has no interest in meeting Trump and suggested that he consult climate scientists if he wants to learn the facts. While the audience warmly greeted her call for action, she, too, was not without her critics.

 “We have to be a little bit between optimism and outrage,” said Oliver Bäte, the chief executive of the German insurance giant Allianz. “I cannot get up every day outraged. We have to do something.”

 Earlier in the day, Thunberg, speaking on another panel, brushed off criticism, saying it was more important to pay attention to the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which has warned how dangerously close the world is to overspending its carbon budget and triggering irreversible climate effects.

 Though Trump barely mentioned climate change, he did commit the United States to a World Economic Forum initiative to plant a trillion new trees as a way to mitigate carbon dioxide emissions. The president pledged that the United States would work to manage and preserve its forests.

 On this, Thunberg withheld her praise, warning that such initiatives were often an excuse for inaction.

 “We are not telling you to offset your emissions by just paying someone else to plant trees in places like Africa, while at the same time forests like the Amazon are being slaughtered at an infinitely higher rate,” she said.

 “Planting trees is good, of course,” Thunberg said. “But it’s nowhere near enough of what is needed, and it cannot replace real mitigation or rewilding nature.”

 Bryant spent his entire 20-year professional career with Los Angeles Lakers where he won five NBA championships, a league MVP and two NBA Finals MVPs. During his career Bryant made 18 All-Star Game appearances, accumulated 33,643 career points and was an 11-time member of the All-NBA First Team.

 As we continue to mourn the death of the basketball legend, newspapers in Los Angeles, USA and across the globe paid tribute to the former Lakers star on their front and back pages.

The slice-of-life film made Rs 1.65 crore on Monday. Film trade analyst Taran Adarsh said that the film was unable to perform in mass circuits, which could mean tier 2 and tier 3 cities, but did well in select metro cities.

 Check out the box office performance of Panga

 Panga revolves around a retired Kabbadi player, essayed by Ranaut, who is hoping to make a comeback in the game. Directed by Ashwiny Iyer Tiwary, also features Richa Chadha, Neena Gupta, Jassie Gill, and Pankaj Tripathi in key roles.

 Speaking about the film to Firstpost, Ashwiny said in an interview, Panga is not a sports drama in its purest form. It is a human story and just like the characters in my previous films they are all real and relatable people. It isn’t a biopic or based on any real person. It’s a very universal idea. It was very important for me to tell this story in the era of co-parenting and supporting each other. Today, we have both, husband and wife distributing work. It’s about co-existing and helping each other. There are hundreds and thousands of ‘Prashants’ and ‘Jayas’ (characters played by Jassi Gill and Kangana) in the country. It is a universal idea.

 The film, which released alongside Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor-starrer Street Dancer 3D, made Rs 2.70 crore on its opening day.

 He was mighty courteous, soft-spoken and endearingly bashful. Bhosle would frequently talk about how big this guy was going to be in Bollywood. He’d smile shyly, speak little and then you’d hear him effortlessly play a few notes on the keyboard, undoubtedly convinced about his bright future. He mentioned something about being a classical pianist, a fact that stood out brilliantly against the backdrop of the playback singing he was looking to do for the Hindi film industry. Suffice to say that if someone mentioned in the 1990s that Sami had the potential to win a Padma award too, I wouldn’t have been surprised.

 His popularity stood in stark contrast in a Bombay that was metamorphosing into Mumbai. The next 10-odd years saw Sami being the recipient of much fame and fortune. He collaborated with Bhosle for the Pakistani film Sargam in 1995, following up that triumph with his immensely successful 2000 album Kabhi To Nazar Milao. The title song and ‘Lift Karaa De’ made Sami a household name and ushered in much Bollywood fame. From Ajnabee to Saathiya, Sami collaborated with the likes of Mani Ratnam, Subhash Ghai and Yash Chopra, establishing his as the lingering voice of a leading man on celluloid.

 From those feted days, Sami’s career graph stuttered progressively; the last decade especially has been least significant. It has seen barely Sami singing for the occasional Hindi film and bagging a few more across regional cinema.

 It has also seen the end of a Pakistani personality on a short-term Indian visa, and the emergence of an Indian national of Pakistani origin. He may have been granted his Indian citizenship in 2016 but the process of applying for it had already been many years in the making. In 2013, Sami while paying tribute to Yash Chopra who apparently served as guarantor for his citizenship application, said, “Before he passed away, Yash uncle made sure all the paperwork for my Indian passport was done. Thanks to him, I am likely to get it.”

 That the Modi government eventually granted him citizenship served as favourable optics for a government that hadn’t yet shamelessly and openly thrust its Hindutva agenda.

 Even as his tweets increasingly displayed his love for his new country, he didn’t defend the government’s silence over the JNU attacks, preferring instead to tweet his support for the students of who were attacked in their campus earlier this month.

 But as the criticism for the National People’s Register and the Citizenship Amendment Act reached fever pitch in 2019, Sami spent much time on Twitter telling online trolls that he wasn’t a refugee and his application was approved after almost two decades of living in India. He came from an affluent Pakistani family that had not been persecuted in their own country, so his move to India was entirely his personal choice and not some political compulsion. He painstakingly replied to everyone who used his citizenship as an example of the current disposition’s benevolence, clarifying that Muslims are not persecuted in theocratic countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh and so need not be specified as possible refugees under the CAA.

 It has long been believed that the Padma awards are a way of rewarding those who sing the ruling party’s tune.

 The dubious winners are few, but they often tend to overshadow the genuine achievers and irreversibly taint the reputation of the awards. Remember when controversial hotelier Sant Chatwal was given the Padma Vibhushan in 2010 despite having criminal cases against him? It was the same year a Padma Shri was given to a Kashmiri counter-insurgent Ghulam Mohammad Mir, a man accused of murder and human rights violations.

 Those attacking Sami over his father’s military background are being ridiculous because his father was a trained defence professional doing his duty, not a terrorist waging war against India. Blaming Sami for his father’s actions is like asking Rahul Gandhi to apologise for his father presiding over the Sikh massacre of 1984.

 Sami himself has no such bloody past, but his most prolific work was too brief and far behind him currently. The criticism for his Padma award shouldn’t be about why he got it, but it should certainly be directed as to why he got it now.

 His best years were between 1995-2009/10. Sami could’ve still been eligible because he was hugely popular in the first half of that duration and the Padma committee neither has a waiting period to see where someone’s career goes, nor does it rule out candidates based on their citizenship. The Padma awards — especially the Padma Shri category — doesn’t lay much emphasis on longevity of a career to recognise great work either. Rahul Dravid won the Padma Shri within nine years of making his international debut. Shah Rukh Khan is not the most prolific actor in the industry but he’s definitely one of India’s most popular exports to the world. He won his Padma Shri in 2005, 13 years after his debut while still being a hugely popular actor. Even Canadian national Akshay Kumar has been honoured with a Padma Shri in 2009.

 Sami isn’t exactly riding the popularity wave today. So if his prime wasn’t as far-reaching as Shah Rukh’s, and he was not lauded in his brief best years, nor was his citizenship the reason for him being belatedly rewarded, why, then, is he a recipient today?

 Ruling parties often take away from the joy of winning awards with their embarrassingly poor timing. Saif Ali Khan had already done Omkara and Being Cyrus, and had had a remarkable career renaissance by the time he won the Padma Shri (2010) but it will frequently be mentioned with a footnote that his mother was the incumbent Central Board of Film Certification chief when he won and his family was friendly with the Gandhis.

 Adnan Sami was once known as being an incredibly talented musician. By awarding him today and making it seem like popular opinion, the government has reduced him to a sycophant.

 I believed Sami would be worthy of high honour. I didn’t once imagine that the move would be this questionable.

1587,0,Hindi,pqr,"West Delhi BJP MP Parvesh Verma on Monday delivered a speech expressing his opposition those protesting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). The parliamentarian asserted that protests at Delhis Shaheen Bagh will be cleared within an hour of the BJP coming to power in the forthcoming Delhi Assembly election on 8 February.

 Verma added that all the existing mosques built on government land will be demolished if the BJP formed government in Delhi on 11 February.

 This is not just another election. It is an election to decide the unity of a nation. If the BJP comes to power on 11 February, you will not find a single protester within an hour. And within a month, we will not spare a single mosque built on government land, Parvesh Verma said, appealing to Delhi voters.

 BJP MP Parvesh Verma while delivering his speech in West Delhi. News18

 He was addressing a crowd at a community centre in Ranhoula village which falls under the Vikaspuri Assembly constituency in West Delhi, News18 reported.

 Elaborating his remarks to news agency ANI on Tuesday, he said, Lakhs of people gather there (Shaheen Bagh)... Theyll enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them. Theres time today, [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi ji and Amit Shah wont come to save you tomorrow.

 Vermas speech comes after Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur raised an an incendiary slogan – traitors should be shot – against anti-CAA protestors on Monday. The Union minister addressing the meeting in support of BJP candidate from Rithala, Manish Chaudhary.

 The incident, where Thakur shouted desh ke gaddaron ko to which the crowd responded goli maro sa*** ko (shoot down the traitors), triggered a row with the Delhi Chief Election Officer seeking a report from the North West districts election officer.

 The sit-in protests, mainly led by women, at South East Delhis Shaheen Bagh have been held for more than a month in opposition to the CAA – which will grant citizenship to all non-Muslim refugees from three neighbouring countries – the NRC and the National Population Register (NPR).

 However, the road blockage due to the demonstrations have led to a tussle between the Delhi Police and the protesters, as its disrupts traffic movement between Delhi and Noida.

 According to some media reports, the BJP, which is facing flak over the contentious law, might hinge its Delhi election campaign on the Shaheen Bagh protests.

 Using the the Shaheen Bagh blitz, the saffron party leaders are under the assumption of isolating Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Congress.

 A BJP leader was quoted by NDTV as saying, It will be difficult for them to support the traffic nightmare in surrounding areas like Sarita Vihar, children not going to school, shops not opening.

 A disturbing video of a man hitting an elephant has surfaced on the internet and is swiftly going viral. Shared on Twitter by Indian Forest Officer Susanta Nanda, the video depicts ruthless behaviour of humans against innocent animals.

 In the video, a man is seen hitting an elephant on its back for no reason. This infuriated the animal and it turned around to retaliate. The elephant ran behind the man to attack him but the man managed to have a lucky escape.

 IFS Officer Susanta Nanda shared the video with the caption, A coward is incapable of exhibiting love- while headlines scream it as man-animal conflict. It was a lucky escape for the idiot. Others will not be on another day. Have compassion brother.

 Check out the video here:

 The mans decision to hit the innocent animal was definitely wrong and the internet is also of the same opinion. Soon after the video was shared, netizens dropped in comments to express their anger.

 I dont know what sadistic & sensational pleasure they get crowding & frightening innocent animals in search of food, a user commented. Elephants have strong memory. This elephant will recognise him now onwards, another user wrote.

 In fact, netizens had a lot to say. Check out more reactions on the video here:

 I dont know what saditistic & sensational pleasure they get crowding & frightening innocent animals in search of food. It was delight to see the leopard cub being given water by kind villagers somewhere in the South. Awareness & empathy is required.

1590,0,English,xyz,"The death toll from a coronavirus outbreak in China has soared to 106 while nearly 1,300 new cases have been confirmed. As of Tuesday, more than 4,000 people have been infected across China, the bulk of them in and around Wuhan. Some reports have stated the symptoms of the infections as runny nose, sore throat, headache, fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, especially for those with weak immune system. There are currently no vaccines available to protect people against the infection that can be transmitted from human to human.

 The deadly coronavirus has also affected people in Australia, Cambodia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, United States, France and Germany.

 China on Tuesday postponed the start of the spring semester for schools and universities across the country over concerns about a deadly virus outbreak. The decision came as the death toll from the new coronavirus soared to 106. Students are currently on holiday for the Lunar New Year and the education ministry did not provide a date for teaching to resume.

 In Britain, around 1,500 people who came to the country from the Chinese epicentre of the epidemic in the past two weeks must put themselves in isolation, the UK health minister said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said authorities cannot be 100 percent certain that the virus cannot spread from a person who exhibits no flu-like symptoms.

 Canadian health authorities also confirmed the countrys first case of a deadly coronavirus, and said the patients wife had also tested positive. The womans case is still listed as presumptive, pending final confirmation by a national lab in Winnipeg, officials said. Nearly 20 people are being monitored.

 The patient confirmed to have the virus — a man in his 50s who arrived in Toronto on January 22 from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic — is being treated in isolation in a hospital there. His wife, who traveled with him, also is believed to have contracted the virus and is in self-isolation, David Williams, Ontario provinces chief medical officer, said in a statement.

 The US State Department has encouraged Americans to reconsider any plans to travel to China. The State Department also issued a stern warning for its citizens not to travel to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. So far, 82 people have died as a result of the virus, all of them in China.

 Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has said it remained unclear if the deadly coronavirus spreading in China and beyond is contagious during its incubation period, before symptoms appear.

 The virus, which can cause a pneumonia-like acute respiratory infection, has in a matter of weeks killed more than 80 people and infected some 2,740 in China, while cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries. In a fresh report on the new virus, known as 2019nCoV, the UN health agency said current estimates put the incubation period for the virus at between two and 10 days.

 Global stocks and oil also dropped as panicked investors fled risky assets for safer bets gold, bonds, the dollar and the yen, after China warned that a deadly new coronavirus was spreading fast. Luxury goods makers and airlines suffered particularly on equity markets, as Chinese tourist spending is a key factor for them. Shares of energy and technology companies were also weak.

 He was addressing a crowd at a community center in Ranhoula village which falls under the Vikaspuri Assembly constituency in West Delhi.

 Protests in Shaheen Bagh erupted spontaneously in opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens and the National Population Register. Mainly led by women, the protests have continued uninterrupted for more than a month now.

1595,0,Telugu,pqr,"Kobe Bryant’s 13-year-old daughter Gianna, who died alongside her father in the helicopter crash that claimed the life of the NBA legend, had shown signs that she could further her father’s glittering basketball legacy.

 Her proud father once said the second-born of the Los Angeles Lakers star’s four daughters with wife Vanessa was “something else” on the basketball court.

 Bryant’s eldest daughter, 17-year-old Natalia, prefers volleyball, Bianka is only three and Capri was only born last year.

 So the 41-year-old NBA great’s basketball hopes were invested in Gianna. “It’s a trip to see her move and the expressions she makes. It’s a trip how genetics work,” Bryant told US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel in 2018.

 “The best thing that happens is when we go out and fans would come up to me and she’ll be standing next to me... and they’ll be like, ‘You’ve gotta have a boy, you and V, gotta have a boy. You gotta have somebody to carry on your tradition, the legacy. She (Gianna) is like, ‘I got this’. I’m like, ‘that’s right’,” he went on. “Yes, you do, you got this.”

 Gianna’s passion for basketball meant she was often pictured sitting alongside her father at games, watching his beloved Lakers at the Staples Center or the WNBA team Los Angeles Sparks.

 She often worked out with her father in the gymnasium of the family’s villa in Newport Beach and he took pride in coaching her high school team when his schedule permitted.

 Gianna was on the helicopter that crashed because she was travelling to a tournament in the Los Angeles suburbs to play for her team, called the Mamba Team, after one of her father’s nicknames.

 One of her teammates was also on board the helicopter and was also among the dead.

 Gianna’s future had already been mapped out – her heart was set on going to Connecticut, the most prestigious women’s basketball program in the US.

 And of course, she had introductions that other young girls players could only dream of – her father’s former agent Rob Pelinka introduced her to basketball stars and coaches.

 Derek Fisher, a Lakers teammate of her father and now coach of the WNBA Sparks, had noticed that Kobe’s steely will to win had rubbed off on Gianna. “They have the similar demeanor and personality,” Fisher said.

1596,0,Tamil ,abc,"Do you still sing?

 All my adult life, I have been asked this question. It inevitably makes me feel apologetic or guilty, because I know the answer should be a resounding musical yes. It should be an answer that contains all the amazing knowledge that was carefully handed to me like pearls and rubies – the secret two-note taan, the rare compositions; that voice training that can send notes soaring high above the skyline.

 My musical journey started when a mother extricated a reluctant ten year old from her comfort zone and sent her to the reclusive and remarkable Dhondutai. She was the only student of the formidable Kesarbai, whose voice and manners could merge robust masculine with seductive feminine energies to create music that has rarely been heard before or after. Dhondutai was not that. But she was an extraordinarily gentle and patient teacher who tolerated the fidgety brat that sat in front of her three days a week for only one reason: she saw in me the qualities that she felt, if nurtured, would carry forth the Jaipur gharana legacy.

 “To be a true musician, you have to be amir or fakir,” she often said. Because, in either case, you have freedom. Through her, I started finding musical metaphors in everything around – the whirring drone of the fan; the recurrent cry of a street vendor; in festivals, in colour, in the scent of sandalwood that snaked out of her dollshouse of gods and goddesses.

 Even when she made tea, she would combine two different strains in a very particular ratio, and compare them to the compound combination ragas, a specialty of the Jaipur gharana. “Like the tea, they should come together so seamlessly, that you should not be able to tell when one raga finishes and the other starts…” she said.

 And so, I grew up at the feet of my third grandmother in this alternate plane where music became breath. I learned Raga Bhoop for more than two years and only when the foundation was unshakable, I was guided further down the road – to the light and lilting Tilak Kamod, the sombre morning notes of Lalit, a plaintive composition in Jaijaiwanti, a majestic Basanti Kedar, and so many more. Some I stayed with; some were only to be able to accompany my teacher in a concert, where I learned how to fill the notes in between and to sustain holding a tanpura without allowing my foot to fall asleep. Indian music is about so much more than music. It is about patience and humility and an understanding that there can be something so immense that one life is scarcely enough.

 I went away to college in America. Although I had a degree from Princeton, I came back to Borivli, to Dhondutai. Like a migratory crane that follows its own bird wisdom. I wanted to become a professional singer. I spent a year in serious training, ignoring the muffled sniggers of friends and my baffled but indulgent parents. I got up early in the morning to train my voice, building each note as gradually as the rising sun. I started paying close attention to the nuances that come when a singer matures, modulating voice and tone, enabling expression and pause.

 But I started faltering. I could not keep up the rigour that this art form requires of its practitioners. One night of partying would reflect in my voice. My friends had jobs and boyfriends. I started realising that I did not have the guts to pursue a seemingly pointless passion in a world where success is measured in terms of how much money you make and how well you are known. I was too scared to carry on. So, I continued to go visit my beloved teacher, but I fell into my second love – writing. I stopped singing.

 A few years ago, I was at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in South Bombay to visit my old friend Suvarnalata Rao. Gleaming musical instruments lined the wall like ancestral portraits. She asked me that dreaded question:

 Do you still sing?

 I replied, “Not really… well, yes, some times, but only for myself.”

 “Why do you say it like that? Do you think singing for oneself is any lesser than singing for an audience? In fact, if you think about it, it gives you much more freedom!”

 I stared at her in wonder. Suddenly, something started lifting, a weight that prevented me from engaging with a space that had once been like breathing. I realised that we have come to define everything in a performative sense, needing external validation, almost becoming a selfie version of ourselves –  the opposite of the inner world you enter when you start a Bhairavi or make that quiet cup of tea.

 I now sing. Not often. Not very well. Not to prove anything, or carry on any legacy. But with joy. Like bird song. Like the devotee who hums prayers alone in a temple. Like breath.

 This first appeared in ON Stage, the official monthly magazine of the National Centre for the Performing Arts, Mumbai.

 Nobel laureate and economist Abhijit Banerjee on Monday flagged the concern that India country might be heading into a recession, and there is “nothing in the data” suggesting otherwise. He re-emphasized the need for the government to address the banking sector. “The banking sector is in doldrums. It needs huge funding from the government. The Centre should also look at infrastructure sector funding,” added the 58-year-old Nobel Laureate.

1599,0,English,pqr,"The new strain of coronavirus spreading across China claimed its first victim in Beijing, officials said on Tuesday, as the death toll climbed to 106, the United States warned citizens against trips to the country and financial markets recoiled again at the potential impact on the world’s second-biggest economy. Amid mounting concern about the virus on Chinese social media, the National Health Commission said in a statement that all but six of those killed by the previously unknown flu-like virus were in Wuhan, Hubei province. Though cases of the virus have been confirmed in other countries, no fatalities have been reported outside China.

 The city of 11 million, where the virus emerged late last year, is now under effective lockdown. Footage shared on China’s Twitter-like Weibo social media platform showed residents of apartment compounds in the city chanting “Wuhan, you can do it!” and singing the national anthem out of their windows. Tuesday’s death toll was up from 81 as of the day before, while the number of total confirmed cases in China surged to 4,515 as of Jan. 27, from 2,835 a day earlier, the National Health Commission said.

 Global stocks fell, oil prices hit three-month lows, and China’s yuan dipped to its weakest level in 2020 as investors worried about damage to the economy from travel bans over the Lunar New Year holiday period, which China extended in a bid to keep people at home. Officially known as ‘2019-nCoV’, the newly identified coronavirus can cause pneumonia, but it is still too early to know just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday offered China whatever help it needed, while the State Department said Americans should “reconsider” visiting all of China due to the virus.

 Canada, which has two confirmed cases of the virus and is investigating 19 more potential cases, warned its citizens to avoid travel to Hubei province. Authorities in Hubei, home to nearly 60 million people, are taking increasing flak from the public over their initial response to the virus, while much of the province is now under travel curbs. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan on Monday to encourage medical workers and promise reinforcements. The most senior leader to visit the city since the outbreak, Li was shown on state TV leading medical workers in chants to boost morale.

 ‘Full confidence’

 China’s ambassador to the United Nations, following a meeting with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday, said the Chinese government “attaches paramount importance to prevention and control of the epidemic”. “China has been working with the international community in the spirit of openness, transparency and scientific coordination,” he said. Guterres said the UN had “full confidence in China’s ability of controlling the outbreak, and stands ready to provide any support and assistance”.

 Communist-ruled China has been eager to seem open and transparent in its handling of the epidemic, having been heavily criticised for its efforts to cover up an epidemic of the SARS coronavirus that killed about 800 people globally in 2002-2003. On China’s heavily censored social media, officials have faced mounting anger over the virus, which is thought to have originated from a Wuhan market where wildlife was sold illegally.

 Some criticised the governor of Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital, after he corrected himself twice during a news conference over the number of face masks being produced. “If he can mess up the data multiple times, no wonder the disease has spread so severely,” said one user of the Weibo social media platform. In rare public self-criticism, Wuhan Mayor Zhou Xianwang said the city’s management of the crisis was “not good enough” and indicated he was willing to resign. Cases linked to people who travelled from Wuhan have been confirmed in a dozen countries, from Germany to the United States. Sri Lanka was among the latest to confirm a case.

 Markets wobble

 Investors are worried that economic output will be hit in the short term as authorities limit travel and extend the week-long New Year holiday – when millions traditionally travel by rail, road and plane – by three days to limit spread of the virus. Asian stocks extended a global selloff on Tuesday. With Chinese markets shut investors were selling the offshore yuan and the Australian dollar as a proxy for risk. Oil was also under pressure as fears about the wider fallout from the virus mounted.

 The U.S. S&P 500 closed down nearly 1.6%. Echoing concern from South Korea on economic consequences, Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura warned that corporate profits and factory production might take a hit from the virus. China is Japan’s second-largest export destination and a huge market for its retailers, while Chinese make up 30% of all tourists visiting Japan.

 During the 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally, air passenger demand in Asia plunged 45%. The travel industry is more reliant on Chinese travellers now, and China’s share of the global economy has quadrupled. Some European tour operators cancelled trips to China, while governments around the world worked on repatriating nationals. Meanwhile Facebook asked employees to suspend non-essential travel to mainland China and told employees who had travelled to China to work from home.

1600,0,Gujarati,xyz,"Yet another business gets hit by deep discounting! Clearly, this strategy can help penetrate and acquire market share only as long the wallet stretches. Uber Eats was no exception to this; even two attempts in this space by Ola (namely, Ola Café and Food Panda) were unsuccessful, with the latter moving to cloud kitchen services, after realizing the restricted penetration potential in the food delivery business. With a customer base that remains loyal only to discounts, stiff competition, and lack of service differentiation, the food delivery industry seems on its way to reaching the last ones standing and driving out smaller players.

 While operational costs are ever-surging (due to increasing discounts, high cost of customer acquisition, time and incentive cost of onboarding an extensive network of restaurants, high investment in the delivery fleet), the revenues are nowhere near reaching any profitability. With the all-equity deal of Uber Eats with Zomato (where Uber obtained a 9.9% stake in Zomato for the entire Uber Eats business), Zomato and Swiggy are the two largest players still standing in the Food Delivery business.

 A high-level look at a couple of the sectors where players used deep discounting clearly shows the importance of deep pockets, product differentiation and value-addition, forward and backward integration, and eventual market consolidation.

 Evident from players across industries, like Snapdeal, Meru Cabs, and Vodafone, who have lost a substantial market share due to the absence of such differentiation (or integration), staying afloat in the cost-sensitive Indian market requires strategic and tactical agility. Not only did Uber Eats enter the market late (in mid-2017), but it also didn’t differentiate itself; it focused only on the deep discounting strategy for market coverage, which proved to be unsustainable. Uber Eats had been looking to exit the market for a year and was in advanced discussions with Swiggy, which didn’t materialize due to differences in valuation estimates and tax implications.

 The two surviving Food Delivery players have systematically differentiated their offerings. Zomato has several services — food blogging, ads, dining, Zomato Gold, etc., while Swiggy is considering grocery and non-rush-hour delivery as its long-term goal, with Swiggy Stores.

 The following table shows a comparison of the pros and cons of the business models of Zomato and Swiggy, and lists the benefits from the deal.

 This deal clearly demarcates a trend of how it is the imperative of any company to add value, integrate other business streams, and to go beyond deep discounting, to gain and maintain an edge in the market. Let us now wait and watch how the last standing two giants of the food delivery business try to outwit each other in the future!

 Kabul: The Taliban claimed responsibility for the downing of a “special American aircraft” flying over Afghanistan on what it described as an intelligence mission, while the U.S. military said there was no indication the plane was hit by hostile fire.

 The crash happened on Monday in the Taliban-controlled Sado Khel area of the Deh Yak district in Ghazni province, the Taliban’s spokesman Zabihullah Mujahed said in a message via WhatsApp.

 “A special American aircraft which was flying over Afghanistan for an intelligence mission was tactically shot down by the Taliban,” Mujahed said. “All on board including high-ranking CIA officers were killed.”

 Hours after the Taliban statement, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan confirmed that a U.S. Bombardier E-11A plane had crashed.

 “While the cause of crash is under investigation, there are no indications the crash was caused by enemy fire,” Colonel Sonny Leggett said in a statement. “Taliban claims that additional aircraft have crashed are false.”

 “Appears we have lost an aircraft,” General David Goldfein, the U.S. Air Force chief of staff, told reporters in Washington. “We don’t know the status of the crew.”

 Earlier on Monday, Afghanistan’s Civil Aviation Authority provided some details.

 “The plane was apparently dispatched for military operations and it took off from Afghanistan territory,” said Ghulam Masoom Massumi, the director of air traffic management at the authority, by phone. “The military plane was not a cargo plane.” Massumi added.

 He gave no details of the size and make of plane or the number of people on board.

 Initially, Afghanistan’s second Vice President, Sarwar Danish, had said that a passenger plane owned by the country’s national carrier, Ariana Afghan Airlines, crashed in the Deh Yak district of Ghazni province. However Ariana denied reports one of its planes was involved and said it was operating as normal.

 The incident follows reports last week the U.S. and the Taliban were moving toward a peace deal that would see the eventual withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan and an end to the 18-year long conflict.

 It’s the second time in recent months the two sides have appeared close to announcing an agreement. In September President Donald Trump abruptly called off talks in response to a suicide bombing in Kabul that killed an American soldier.

 The militant group controls or contests half of the country, more territory than any time since they were toppled in 2001. The U.S. currently has 13,000 of the 22,673 foreign troops in Afghanistan, down from a peak of 100,000 in 2011.

1602,0,Tamil ,abc,"Those applying for Indian nationality under the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, will have to prove their religion, officials aware of the matter have said.

 The amended citizenship act aims to grant Indian citizenship to minorities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhist, Christians and Parsis from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who have faced or fear religious persecution.

 The law, which excludes Muslims, will be applicable to those who entered India before December 2014.

 The officials cited above said the government is unlikely to ask for proof of religious persecution from these people in their original country, even as the Union home ministry is in the process of framing rules for the new law.

 “The rules are being drafted but to benefit under the CAA one will have to show some proof of their religion. Any government document like school enrolment of children, Aadhaar etc would enough,” a senior official said on condition of anonymity.

 They added that the applicants will also have to furnish documents to prove that they entered India before 2015.

 “Requirement of proof of their religious beliefs and their entry date will be included in the rules. This will be useful so that random persons do not apply for Indian citizenship,” one of the officials said.

 It was not immediately clear what the nature of the documentation required for applying for citizenship will be.

 Earlier, deposing before a Joint Parliamentary Committee on Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2016, security agencies and government had indicated religious persecution could be verified through security agencies like the Research and Analysis Wing(R&AW) - India’s external intelligence agency.

 “The law allows faster citizenship in two cases religious persecution or fear of religious persecution, therefore a check back on whether there was religious persecution isn’t critical,” a second senior home ministry official, who didn’t want to be named, said.

 The rules to implement CAA is also likely to have special provisions for Assam—a state that has witnessed continuous peaceful agitation by the civil society and people at large. There is an apprehension that allowing citizenship through CAA would hurt the interest of the indigenous people.

 The government is also likely to give a relatively smaller window of three months to those who want to apply for citizenship in Assam under the CAA, a second official said.

 The BJP led-Assam government had asked the Centre to limit the time frame for applications for citizenship under the CAA.

 “The number of people who are likely to benefit from CAA in the northeast, and especially Assam, is small. Once that becomes clear protests are likely to die out,” a senior Assam government functionary said.

 The CAA came into force on January 10 and the Union home ministry is framing the rules that will govern the law.

 Civil society bodies, students and several states have opposed the law and protests have continued across the country, including Delhi. A few state assemblies have even passed resolutions opposing the law and urging the Centre to withdraw it.

1603,0,Hindi,pqr,"Police in Bihar’s Jehanabad on Tuesday detained the brother of Sharjeel Imam, a student of Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) booked for sedition after his alleged “inflammatory and instigating” speech.

 Delhi Police have booked Imam, one of the organisers of the anti-citizenship act protests in the city’s Shaheen Bagh, for his alleged remarks threatening to “cut-off” Assam from the rest of India. Cases have also been registered against him in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

 If convicted under Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) he could be imprisoned for life.

 Before this, he had been booked on similar charges by Aligarh Police in Uttar Pradesh for a speech he delivered on the Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) campus.

 Police picked up his brother Muzzamil Imam, a political worker associated with the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in Jehanabad, for questioning, officials said.

 Muzzamil’s detention came a day after a police team from Delhi and Bihar had raided several places from Jehanabad to Patna in search of anti-citizenship act activist Sharjeel Imam on Monday.

 The police after searching different locations at Jehanabad and his native village at Kako, raided some places in Patna including Sabzibagh area, after getting information that he was hiding in the state capital.

 Officials had said that Sharjeel Imam’s last mobile location was found to be in Patna on Saturday and later some people spotted him in Jehanabad as well.

 Jehanabad’s superintendent of police Manish Kumar said police raided on Imam’s ancestral house under the Kako police station area on Sunday night after “help was sought by central agencies”.

 Imam, the son of former Janata Dal(United) leader late Akbar Imam, could not be found but two of his relatives and their driver were detained for interrogation and let off thereafter, the SP said and added that his family has been advised to ask him to surrender.

 His mother, Agsan Rahim, had alleged on Saturday that the media had distorted his statements and the police were “unnecessarily harassing the family.”

 “My son is innocent. I do not know about his whereabouts but can swear by God that he is innocent. He is a bright young man. But I can guarantee that upon learning about the cases, he will appear before the investigating agencies and fully cooperate in the probe,” she said.

 She said it has been a long time since she met her son though she had a telephonic conversation with him a few weeks ago.

 “He was obviously disturbed by the CAA and fears over the National Register of Citizens (NRC) being implemented across the country which, he said, would affect not just Muslims but all poor people,” she said.

 His uncle Arshad Imam said the entire village and community respect the judiciary and Constitution. He, however, rued that fact that the statements have been distorted to suit the political needs.

 “A 40-second video of the 40-minute speech is being presented. It is being exaggerated. Every Indian has the right to protest,” said Imam, who was also interrogated by the police.

 Sharjeel Imam is a graduate in computer science from IIT-Mumbai

 “After remaining in the teaching profession for some time, he joined a software company. He resigned from the service and joined JNU in 2017 do PhD in modern history,” a villager, who did not want to be named, said.

 “Sharjeel is the eldest of two brothers and his father contested the October 2005 assembly polls on JD(U) ticket. He passed away five years ago,” the villager said.

1604,0,English,xyz,"Batting coach Vikram Rathour on Tuesday called the new generation of Indian cricketers “incredible” and said the team management has already identified the core of players for the T20 World Cup in October-November.

 Rathour was speaking ahead of the third T20I between India and New Zealand at Seddon Park on Wednesday, with the Men in Blue leading the five-match series 2-0.

 “Adjustments will keep going on till the last minute. But as far as I am concerned and the team management is concerned, we have the core. We know what our team is going to be. Unless there is a case of injury or really bad loss in form, I don’t see many changes happening,” said Rathour.

 With one eye on T20 World Cup in Australia, India have been on experimentation mode since the start of the home season in September last year, giving opportunities to host of a youngsters including Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Deepak Chahar and Shivam Dube.

 The T20 team has been doing really well in New Zealand and the young guns have contributed significantly to its success, leaving the batting coach hugely impressed.

 “This new generation of cricketers is incredible. I find it amazing actually that they turn up and they are at their best straightaway across different format, different grounds and different countries actually. The amount of time they took to get settled (here in NZ)) was outstanding actually,” he said.

 India won the twin matches in Auckland thanks to brilliant outings from KL Rahul and Iyer. The batting coach expressed satisfaction that the younger batsmen are stepping forward for the team’s cause.

 “The more opportunities that these guys get, they are showing that they are capable. They are showing that they are match-winners on their day. That will help the team, of course, but it will also help their confidence.

 “Having seen KL (Rahul) and Shreyas as young cricketers coming through, in my mind, I have absolutely no doubt that they are match-winners. They are getting their opportunities now and they are showing the world what they are capable of, that is great to see,” he said.

 “Apart from having those (batting) skills, I think the mindset is amazing. He (Iyer) believes he is a big player, and he is, without any doubt. He genuinely believes that he is a match-winner and he is here to stay. And that mind set I think helps him, that is the biggest advantage he has,” he said.

 When asked about the ability of current generation to learn from the IPL whilst maintaining percentage shots as big hits, Rathour said, “Big power-hitters and all, that time was there initially, people used to think T20 is more to do with power-hitting but it’s not the case anymore. Proper cricketing shots, you still get value for shots.”

 Talking about the adaptation needed from one format to another, the coach said, “Players play so much cricket these days, all three formats consistently, day-in, day-out, they are making these adjustments on their own. The game of cricket has changed with times. Even in Test cricket, big shots are common. I don’t think it is that big a difference.

 “It is more of a mindset thing and about game plan. As a coach, I don’t think we really need to tell them anything. They are doing it on their own. They are stronger, fitter than from our generation. You can see that they are hitting big sixes and without any effort, that way the game has changed.”

 The next three games at Hamilton, Wellington and Mt. Maunganui will be played at regular-sized grounds unlike Eden Park in Auckland. Rathour hinted that there won’t be many alterations to the team’s strategy, apart from the bowlers firming up new plans as per conditions on offer.

 “You look at the conditions and go. It (Seddon Park) is a bigger ground, it is a regular ground, but we are still looking to play normal cricket, good cricket. I don’t think it alters anything. Maybe for the bowlers with their lengths, but with the batters, doesn’t make any difference.

 “On bigger grounds (like in Australia), running between wickets will cover the game plan. A good game plan is about players who look at the situation, conditions and accordingly bat. If we play on bigger grounds, I am sure this team is capable of running twos and threes and adjust their game accordingly,” he said.

 A-tour helps a lot. In case of any injuries, if you are looking for any replacements, we know players are here, just a city away. They can immediately come in and they are already acclimatized to the conditions. I think thats a great idea and thats working really well for our team.

 The foreign pitches are getting more even and even. There is not that vast a difference now like it used to be earlier. And the amount of cricket these guys are playing, as a coach you cant do anything about not having practice sessions but they are adjusting beautifully.

 Nobody is cribbing, no one is complaining. You dont see anyone talking about grass on the wicket, moisture, etc, he added.

 Making shocking accusations against the protesters, he further said: “They will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters”.

 “This is not just another election. It is an election to decide the unity of a nation. If the BJP comes to power on February 11, you will not find a single protester within an hour. And within a month, we will not spare a single mosque built on government land,” said Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma.

 Further speaking to news agency ANI, he said: “…Lakhs of people gather there (Shaheen Bagh). People of Delhi will have to think and take a decision. They will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them. There’s time today, Modi ji and Amit Shah won’t come to save you tomorrow…”

 Verma was campaigning for the February 8 Delhi Assembly Election in Vikaspuri.

 Shaheen Bagh has become a key site of the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and NRC.

 Earlier, Union Home Minister Amit Shah had also lashed out at those protesting against CAA at Shaheen Bagh. The BJP leader has consistently made Shaheen Bagh, the much talked about anti-CAA protest site in Delhi, a key election issue.

 Addressing an election rally, Amit Shah had said: “When you press the button (on the voting machine) on February 8, do so with such anger that its current is felt at Shaheen Bagh.”

 According to the new law, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities, who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, till December 31, 2014, facing religious persecution there, will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

 The opposition parties have termed the legislation as “unconstitutional” which “is aimed at diverting attention from the burning issues of the common people”.

 Those opposing the amended law say it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA, along with the proposed pan-India National Register of Citizens (NRC), is intended to target India’s Muslim community.

 However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government has dismissed the allegations, maintaining that the law is intended to give citizenship to the persecuted people from the three neighbouring countries and not take away citizenship from anyone.

 The Duchess of Cambridge, Kate Middleton made a chic statement as she made an appearance at a service to mark the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz-Birkenau liberation at Westminsters Central Hall. 27th January marks as the Holocaust Memorial Day in the United Kingdom and the Duke & the Duchess made sure to pay their respect to all the people who lost their lives.

 For the solemn service, Kate Middleton put on a smile for all the people waiting outside. While doing so, she also made sure to look her absolute best as she wrapped herself up in a cosy grey coat by Catherine Walker. The full-sleeved, padded shouldered coat bore a black collar that made a contrasting statement while a matching belt cinched her waist. The A-line silhouette perfectly flattered her as she paired it with a pair of black stockings. She then styled it with a pair of black pointy pumps and her signature curls that gracefully brushed her shoulders. She then pulled half of her hair in an elegant pin-up while her skin glowed with blushed cheeks and soft smokey eyes. A pair of pearl stud earrings completed her look.

 While the Duchess looked chic, she gave us another styling cue on how to recycle our old wardrobe. Middleton who wore the coat back in March, last year has styled it with a black hat, opaque tights and block-heeled pumps. She wore it out with the Monarch, Queen Elizabeth who was out in a bright pink ensemble.

 What are your thoughts about it? Did you like her look? Let us know in the comments section below.

 Women have been so enslaved by mens opinion of how women should look at this photograph of Priyanka to me at the worlds most publicized event is the height of liberation.

 You go girl and keep rocking it. I was never a fan of the lady but this pic has surely made me one

 So dear men. We are not ur pre-pubescent hipless perverted fantasy or your teenage gay boy flat chested contortion. We are real women, we have breasts, we have fat we have water retention and we rock and roll

 Because ...we are finally allowing ourselves as God intended us to be. Not how men fantasized us to be. We are flesh and blood and glorious rolls of it. It gets even more beautiful when we have babies and the rolls grow - in direct adverse proportion to the dark areas in your primitive brain

 So dear ugly men get this. We are not our bodies

 We are our abilities. We are our talent. We are our rock stars

 Would anybody have dared comment on a mans belly or appearance like this? God knows we see grotesque images of them every day and all the time

 More power to you #PriyankaChopra. Im going to flash my flabby baby stretch marks with confidence tomorrow thanks to you. And may every girl and woman in the world grow your confidence too. Bless you

1619,0,Hindi,pqr,"Los Angeles: Los Angeles Lakers players will have more time to mourn the death of Kobe Bryant before returning to the court after the NBA on Monday postponed Tuesdays game against the Los Angeles Clippers.

 The Staples Center matchup, which was to be the first game on the Lakers home court since Lakers legend Bryant died in a helicopter crash Sunday, will be rescheduled for a later date.

 The decision was made out of respect for the Lakers organization, which is deeply grieving the tragic loss, the NBA said in announcing a postponement.

 The next scheduled Lakers game is on Friday at Staples Center against Portland.

 In the wake of the postponement, the Lakers made their first public comment since Bryants death, thanking fans for support while acknowledging the heartache involved.

 The Los Angeles Lakers would like to thank all of you for the tremendous outpouring of support and condolences, the team statement said.

 This is a very difficult time for all of us. We continue to support the Bryant family and will share more information as it is available.

 Lakers star Anthony Davis, averaging 26.5 points and 9.1 rebounds a game, unveiled the depth of the grief being felt over the tragedy in an Instagram posting Monday, noting how personal the loss of Bryant was after Davis had been mentored by the icon.

 Man this is a tough one for me! Davis wrote. You were the first guy to put me under your wing and show me the ins and outs of the league. Had so many great convos about so many things and I will cherish those moments forever. Love you forever, Bean!

 Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other people were killed in the crash in the suburban Los Angeles hills near Calabasas, California.

 An outpouring of grief from fans and athletes worldwide has included thousands in Los Angeles who have gathered outside the arena and left items in tribute to Bryant, who retired in 2016 after 20 seasons with the Lakers.

 Bryant is considered by many the most outstanding athlete from any LA sports team.

 The Lakers own the second-best record in the NBA at 36-10, the best mark in the Western Conference.

 Lakers star LeBron James overtook Bryant for third on the NBAs all-time scoring list in a loss Saturday at Philadelphia only hours before the fatal crash.

 TEARS FLOW DOWN RIVERS

 The emotions being felt around the league and especially in LA were on display when Clippers coach Glenn Doc Rivers fought back tears Sunday before his teams 112-97 victory at Orlando.

 The news is just devastating to everybody who knew him, Rivers said, his voice cracking as he wiped a tear from his right cheek.

 He means a lot to me obviously. He was such a great opponent. Its what you want in sports. He had that DNA that very few athletes can ever have -- the Tiger Woodses and Michael Jordans. Yeah, this is a tough one.

 As difficult as Tuesdays game would have been on the Lakers, Rivers made it clear the Clippers were grief-stricken as well.

 Looking at my young players and seeing how devastated they are -- they knew him -- this is just shocking news for us, he said. I have to go talk to a team before a game and tell them to go play -- and I cant.

 Rivers paused and wept before struggling to continue.

 This is a great loss for the league. I thought he had so much more left to do and he was starting to do it. I had never seen him happier, Rivers said.

 Right now everybody is a Lakers fan. Were all Lakers right now.

 Federer, who took the first set, had the tide completely turned around in the second set that Sandgren took 6-2. He was a break down early on in the third set when he let his emotions out through cusses.

 However, Federers language was picked up by the line judge near him and the chair umpire, Marijana Veljovic, issued a warning for the same. She told Federer that the line judge clearly heard him cuss.

 Federer was then told by the line judge that he gets paid to snitch.

 A frustrated Federer then walked up to Veljovic, who unscrewed the mic, leaned forward, spoke to the Swiss and handled the matter.

 Soon after the incident, Federer also took a medical timeout to get his leg treated.

 Federer has clearly not been at his best with Sandgren executing those booming serves of his to perfection. While the Swiss was all over the American in the first set, his level dropped off in the second and he paid for it.

 So far in the tournament, Federer has already played a five-setter against John Millman and then won in four sets against Fucsovics in the fourth round.

",Australian Open: Federer Gets Warned for Obscene Language During Quarter-final vs Sandgren,Mumbai,Kobe Bryant
1621,0,Telugu,xyz,"Hamilton: Batting coach Vikram Rathour on Tuesday called the new generation of Indian cricketers incredible and said the team management has already identified the core of players for the T20 World Cup in October-November.

 Rathour was speaking ahead of the third T20I between India and New Zealand at Seddon Park on Wednesday, with the Men in Blue leading the five-match series 2-0.

 Adjustments will keep going on till the last minute. But as far as I am concerned and the team management is concerned, we have the core. We know what our team is going to be. Unless there is a case of injury or really bad loss in form, I dont see many changes happening, said Rathour.

 With one eye on T20 World Cup in Australia, India have been on experimentation mode since the start of the home season in September last year, giving opportunities to host of a youngsters including Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Deepak Chahar and Shivam Dube.

 The T20 team has been doing really well in New Zealand and the young guns have contributed significantly to its success, leaving the batting coach hugely impressed.

 This new generation of cricketers is incredible. I find it amazing actually that they turn up and they are at their best straightaway across different format, different grounds and different countries actually. The amount of time they took to get settled (here in NZ)) was outstanding actually, he said.

 India won the twin matches in Auckland thanks to brilliant outings from KL Rahul and Iyer. The batting coach expressed satisfaction that the younger batsmen are stepping forward for the teams cause.

 The more opportunities that these guys get, they are showing that they are capable. They are showing that they are match-winners on their day. That will help the team, of course, but it will also help their confidence.

 Having seen KL (Rahul) and Shreyas as young cricketers coming through, in my mind, I have absolutely no doubt that they are match-winners. They are getting their opportunities now and they are showing the world what they are capable of, that is great to see, he said.

 Rathour feels Iyers mindset makes him a better player.

 Apart from having those (batting) skills, I think the mind set is amazing. He (Iyer) believes he is a big player, and he is, without any doubt. He genuinely believes that he is a match-winner and he is here to stay. And that mind set I think helps him, that is the biggest advantage he has, he said.

 When asked about the ability of current generation to learn from the IPL whilst maintaining percentage shots as big hits, Rathour said, Big power-hitters and all, that time was there initially, people used to think T20 is more to do with power-hitting but its not the case anymore. Proper cricketing shots, you still get value for shots.

 Talking about the adaptation needed from one format to another, the coach said: Players play so much cricket these days, all three formats consistently, day-in, day-out, they are making these adjustments on their own. The game of cricket has changed with times. Even in Test cricket, big shots are common. I dont think it is that big a difference.

 It is more of a mind set thing and about game plan. As a coach, I dont think we really need to tell them anything. They are doing it on their own. They are stronger, fitter than from our generation. You can see that they are hitting big sixes and without any effort, that way the game has changed.

 The next three games at Hamilton, Wellington and Mt. Maunganui will be played at regular-sized grounds unlike Eden Park in Auckland. Rathour hinted that there wont be many alterations to the teams strategy, apart from the bowlers firming up new plans as per conditions on offer.

 You look at the conditions and go. It (Seddon Park) is a bigger ground, it is a regular ground, but we are still looking to play normal cricket, good cricket. I dont think it alters anything. Maybe for the bowlers with their lengths, but with the batters, doesnt make any difference.

 On bigger grounds (like in Australia), running between wickets will cover the game plan. A good game plan is about players who look at the situation, conditions and accordingly bat. If we play on bigger grounds, I am sure this team is capable of running twos and threes and adjust their game accordingly, he said.

 Since his appointment as batting coach of the senior team, a part of Rathours brief has been to bring up the younger batsmen in the side. In that aspect, he expressed satisfaction in terms of how the younger generation is coming through via A-tours.

 A-tour helps a lot. In case of any injuries, if you are looking for any replacements, we know players are here, just a city away. They can immediately come in and they are already acclimatized to the conditions. I think thats a great idea and thats working really well for our team.

 The foreign pitches are getting more even and even. There is not that vast a difference now like it used to be earlier. And the amount of cricket these guys are playing, as a coach you cant do anything about not having practice sessions but they are adjusting beautifully.

 Nobody is cribbing, no one is complaining. You dont see anyone talking about grass on the wicket, moisture, etc, he added.

1622,0,Gujarati,abc,"Jaipur, Jan 28 (PTI) Rajasthan cricketer Vineet Saxena, whose marathon double hundred in the final helped the state win the Ranji Trophy in 2011-12, has announced retirement from the game.

 The 39-year-old right-hander made his Ranji debut in 1998-99 against Bengal and represented Uttarakhand against Vidarbha in his last match in 2018-2019.

 He is the only cricketer from Rajasthan to play 100 or more Ranji matches in a career spanning more than two decades.

 While turning up for Rajasthan, Railways and Uttarakhand during his career, Saxena played 129 matches scoring 7637 runs, including one double hundred, 17 hundreds, and 38 half centuries at an average of 36.89.

 The highest point of his career was a marathon 257 against Tamil Nadu in the Ranji final of 2011-12 season which earned him the Man of the Match award and helped Rajasthan win the coveted title for a second consecutive time.

 He also created the unique record of batting on all the five days of Ranji final. He was at the crease for 904 minutes and his 257 was the third longest innings in final.

 Apart from his feats in domestic cricket, he also represented India in the under-19 category against Sri Lanka.

 I have been among the top scorers in the domestic cricket but got little opportunities at the top level but I am happy with what I could achieve in my long career, said Saxena.

 The batsman said he is keen on taking up coaching now.

 I have done my BCCI level one coaching course so I wish to pursue coaching post retirement. It is time to give back to sport whatever it has given me, he said.

 I have what I could for Rajasthan Cricket. I was there in both the finals which Rajasthan won. I have informed about my retirement to Rajasthan Cricket Association (RCA) and the BCCI, he added.

1623,0,Tamil ,abc,"Asim was apparently hitting on Shefali before flirting with Himanshi Khurana (Picture credit - Instagram)

 Contestants flirting and falling in love with each other inside the Bigg Boss house is not something novel. In the previous seasons, we have seen celebrities changing their relationship status on the show. The ongoing thirteenth edition is no different. Model Asim Riaz entered the house as single, but he is definitely walking out as committed. On tonights episode of Bigg Boss 13, we will see him getting down on his knees and proposing to Punjabi singer, Himanshi Khurana, who was evicted from the show a couple of weeks back. Himanshi will re-enter the house this week as a guest to be by Asims side as the show heads to the finale in less than three weeks. While a lot of us are excited to see this love story on Bigg Boss 13, Shefali Jariwala, who was eliminated from Bigg Boss 13 last weekend has revealed something shocking about Asim.

 In an interview with The Times Of India, Shefali revealed that Asim was hitting on her when she entered the house as a wild card contestant last month. Asim did hit on me initially. It wasn’t direct, but everyone in the house had sensed it. However, I made it clear to him that I am a much older, married woman, and I am not interested. That’s when he shifted his focus to Himanshi, who, too, didn’t give him any attention back then. So, he used my friendship and me to get close to her. I have never taken a fancy for Asim. Yes, I did love him as a friend; I always called him my little kiddo in the house, she was quoted. Bigg Boss 13: Asim Riaz Is Dating A Model? Himanshi Khurana Are You Listening (Watch Video)

 Now that is surprising, no? Shefali also spoke about the animosity between Sidharth Shukla and Asim. She said that they both are good players, and added that she doesnt really understand what Rashami Desai is doing in the house. Shefali said, Irrespective of the kind of game they play — negative or positive — Sidharth and Asim are good. Paras is also a very good player, he knows how to manipulate and play with your psyche. Shehnaz Gill, too, is a player. She knows exactly what she is doing, she is not a child. I don’t think Rashami is a good player, I don’t know what she is doing in the house. Well, word has it that Shefali too will re-enter the house to support Paras Chhabra. How excited are you for tonights episode of Bigg Boss 13? Let us know by tweeting to us @LatestLY.

 This is not the first time that the choreographer has faced harassment charges. Earlier, when Tanushree Dutta had accused Nana Patekar of misbehaving with her on the set of Horn Ok Pleassss in 2008, in which she was supposed to do a special dance number, she had also lashed out at Acharya. She had also accused Acharya (who was the choreographer of the song) along with film’s director Rakesh Sarang and producer Samee Siddique of ganging up against her and witnessing everything happening, without doing anything about it.

 Speaking about the allegations, Acharya had then told the media, I would like to highlight this that the Tanushree case is completely false and a dramatic story. When I choreograph some song, then the artist, along with the dancers crew, do rehearsals about five days prior to the shooting. If any harassment had happened, how come other actors and crew members were not aware about it?

1629,0,Telugu,abc,"The New Year has begun and a couple of films have already hit screens, but the big ticket films are yet to see the light of day. Like every year, this year too we at Bollywood Hungama quite literally are sticking our necks out vouching for these films, which in all likelihood will be big money spinners at the box office.

 Last year, our predictions were in point, with some of the films from the Dark Horse category actually making it big at the box office. So this year, putting our reputation on the line again, here are the films that we expect will be making it big at the box office in 2020. This year we have further categorized the films into segments based on their estimated box office collections.

 Laal Singh Chaddha: Aamir Khan has over the year carved a niche for himself in the industry and in the audiences’ minds. With just a single release a year, the actor ensures to focus everything on that single project making it that much more intriguing to watch. Now, in 2020 Aamir Khan will return to the big screen after a two year gap (his last release being in 2018 with Thugs of Hindostan), with Laal Singh Chaddha.

 But if just Aamir Khan wasn’t enough, the film is an adaptation of the Tom Hanks film Forrest Gump that has today achieved cult status. Besides this, given the buzz surrounding the film and the anticipation to watch Aamir essay Tom’s character in the Indian version, trade estimates predict that the film could well see collections in excess of Rs. 250 cr.

 Prithviraj: Over the past few years, Akshay Kumar has emerged as one of the most bankable Bollywood actors with each of his films achieving box office success. In 2020 we see Kumar delve into a period drama with the film Prithviraj. Base on the life of King Prithviraj Chauhan the film is being produced by Yash Raj Films and helmed by Chandraprakash Dwivedi.

 Given the content of the film its cast and production banner, trade expectations state that Prithviraj will be mounted on a lavish scale. If what we hear is anything to go by, the content coupled with Akshay Kumar’s star power at the box office is sure to propel the film past the Rs. 200 cr. mark at the box office.

 Sooryavanshi: After featuring in four releases in 2019, Akshay Kumar will be seen in multiple films this year as well. Following Prithviraj, the next Akshay Kumar starrer that is expected to rake in the moolah is the cop actioner Sooryavanshi.

 Coming as the yet another cop film from Rohit Shetty after Singham 1& 2, and Simmba, Sooryavanshi not only boasts of Akshay Kumar but also features cameos by Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh in their respective avatars. Given this, it is safe to say that Sooryavanshi might just go past the Rs. 200 cr. mark at the box office.

 ’83: What do you get when you take one of Bollywood’s leading entertainer directed by a maverick visionary and have them work together on a project based on the country’s biggest sporting win? The answer is simple, you have ’83, starring Ranveer Singh, directed by Kabir Khan and based on India’s 1983 Cricket World Cup win.

 Now, this film combines Indians’ love for cricket with their love of entertainment creating a visual spectacle that is sure to enthral. Knowing this, it comes as no surprise that trade pundits are predicting big box office numbers for ‘83.

 Brahmastra: In 2018 Ranbir Kapoor was the toast of the industry after his film Sanju, which was based on the life of actor Sanjay Dutt stunned everyone at the box office. Two years later and he will be seen sharing scree space with Alia Bhatt in an Ayan Mukherji directorial Brahmastra.

 Though the film has been in the making for a while now, the buzz surrounding it seems to be increasing by the day. Boasting of a stellar cast with a rather intriguing concept the film is one of the most keenly anticipated releases. Given this fact, estimates suggest that the business of Brahmastra could easily reach Rs. 150 cr.

 RRR: Post the success of Baahubali – The Beginning and Baahubali 2 – The Conclusion, director SS Rajamouli is working on his next RRR. Said to be bigger and grander than his previous cinematic out RRR not only has some of the biggest names from the South, but also from Bollywood and Hollywood. This massive star cast coupled with a stellar story and of course Rajamouli’s direction surely makes this film one of the most anticipated releases of 2020.

 Laxmmi Bomb: Yet another south remake that Akshay Kumar will feature in is Laxmmi Bomb. Written and directed by Raghava Lawrence the film is said to be a Hindi remake of Lawrence’s film Kanchana.

 Going by the buzz that surrounded Laxmmi Bomb after the release of its poster, trade predictions claim that the film could easily achieve the Rs. 150 cr. mark at the box office.

 Shamshera: In 2018 Ranbir Kapoor featured in the title role in the Rajkumar Hirani directorial Sanju. Based on the life of actor Sanjay Dutt the film went on to rock the box office setting new benchmarks. Two years later, the Kapoor scion returns with a period action adventure in the form of Shamshera. Produced under the banner of Yash Raj Films, Shamshera comes with immense buzz especially since the film is being mounted to a massive scale.

 However, it isn’t only the scale of the film, but also its star cast that has the audience anticipating its release. Alongside Ranbir, Shamshera also stars Sanjay Dutt and Vaani Kapoor.

 Baaghi 3: Back in 2016 we saw the release of the film Baaghi that saw Tiger Shroff indulge in some death defying action. Two years later Sajid Nadiadwala produced a second instalment with Baaghi 2 that saw Tiger take the lead once again. Now egged on with the stellar box office performance of the first two action thrillers Nadiadwala and Tiger are reuniting for Baaghi 3 which promises to be that much bigger.

 Besides this, given Tiger’s recent success with War, trade expectations are that seeing him in an action avatar yet again will certainly be a treat for the audience. Thanks to this early estimates state that the film could easily make it past the Rs. 150 cr. mark at the box office.

 Radhe – Your Most Wanted Bhai: After their association in Wanted, and Dabangg 3 Salman Khan and Prabhu Dheva are reuniting for Radhe. Yet another Salman Khan action extravaganza, the film which is slated to hit screens on Eid 2020 promises all the punch and thrill that is associated with a conventional Salman starrer.

 This coupled with the fact that Salman Khan films that release on Eid usually manage to do well at the box office, is a reasonable indicator that Radhe will cross the Rs. 150 cr. mark.

 Coolie No 1: Varun Dhawan has fast garnered a fan following that can rival most Bollywood actors. This ardent following Varun has is thanks to his attitude, acting prowess and of course his entertaining persona. Now imagine this actor starring in a remake of what is now considered a cult movie, and one has the recipe for success. This is exactly what Coolie No 1 is.

 Looking at the current trend, estimates state that Coolie No 1 could reach Rs. 100 cr. at the box office if not more.

 Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2: What happens when you combine the current youth heartthrob Kartik Aaryan and Anees Bazmee, who is known for his comic capers together? Well the answer is Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2.

 Jersey: South remake seem to be the flavour of the season for Shahid Kapoor. After his success with Kabir Singh which was a remake of Arjun Reddy, Shahid has now commenced work on another south remake Jersey. Interestingly the film will combine India’s passion for the sport of cricket with Bollywood which essentially translates into a wider audience. Given these facts, trade expectations are that the business of the film in all likelihood will go past the Rs. 100 cr. mark.

 Shubh Mangal Zyada Saavdhan: After the critically acclaimed film Shub Mangal Saavdhan that shot Ayushmann Khurrana into the limelight we see the actor return with a sequel. Known for his high on content film Ayushmann has fast become an audience favourite. Thanks to his unconventional mix of content and entertainment, Ayushmann has managed to create a new formula for box office success.

 Satyameva Jayate 2: After the success of the 2018 release Satyameva Jayate, John Abraham returns to the big screens with the sequel Satyameva Jayate 2. Like the first this one too boasts of high octane action and stunt sequences that will see Abraham doing what he does best. Going by the current buzz surrounding the film trade experts state that Satyameva Jayate 2 has all the markings to emerge as a sleeper hit.

 Maidaan: Ajay Devgn seems to be on top of his game, with multiple hits under his belt, the actor recently commenced work on his sports film Maodaan. Based on Indian football coach Syed Abdul Rahim, who led the Indian team to the semi-finals of the 1956 Melbourne Olympic Football tournament making India the first ever Asian country to achieve this place. Given the film’s subject matter and the buzz surrounding it, Maidaan could emerge as one of the sleeper hits of 2020.

 Gulabo Sitabo: Starring Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana the film is directed by Shoojit Sircar, however not much about the story of the venture is known, but given the cast and the director the trade predicts that this film could turn out to be a big one at the box office.

 Angrezi Medium: Irrfan Khan is one actor who is known for the roles he plays and the performances he gives on the big screen. After the success of English Medium, Irrfan returns for a sequel of sorts with Angrezi Medium. Now given the success of the previous venture, expectations are that the sequel that much like the first deals with current topics will definitely strike a chord with the audience propelling the film at the box office.

 Gangubai Kathiawadi: A biographical crime film directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali starring Alia Bhatt is exactly what Gangubai Kathiawadi is. While one is known for his opulence in films that brings stories to life the other is known for her performances that give character meaning and depth. Combine these two and you have a success story. But if that wasn’t enough, the buzz surrounding the film and the response the first poster has received promises that Gangubai Kathiawadi could easily be a big ticket money spinner this year.

 Roohi Afzana: Comedy horror is a rather less explored genre; however off late we have seen Indian filmmakers venturing into this territory. Now the latest is the film Roohi Afzana starring Rajkummar Rao, Janhvi Kapoor and Varun Sharma. Though nothing much is known about the film, Roohi Afzana could make a mark at the box office thanks to its cast and fresh pairing.

 Attack: Action thrillers are usually rather bankable film concepts at the Indian box office. But Attack takes it a bit higher featuring John Abraham who has fast become a rather prominent fixture for action films. Alongside Abraham the film will also feature Jacqueline Fernandez and Rakul Preet Singh, directed by Lakshya Raj Anand the film tells the story of a hostage crisis that is inspired by true events. Given these facts Attack that has all the ingredients of hit might just set the box office register jingling.

 Tanhaji – The Unsung Warrior: The Ajay Devgn – Saif Ali Khan starrer Tanhaji – The Unsung Warrior has been making all the right moves in the run up to its release. Telling the story of a rather unknown hero this period drama has all the markings of a hit. And aiding the film further is the fact that both the lead actor’s performances have been appreciated by the audience.

 Given these facts, trade expectations are that Tanhaj – The Unsung Warrior might just emerge as a money spinner at the box office.

 NOTE - The article was written in first week of January 2020 and published on 28 January 2020; hence Tanhaji - The Unsung Warrior, though released on 10 January 2020 finds its mention in the Dark Horse category as envisaged at that point in time.

1630,0,English,abc,"Ajay Devgn has teased his upcoming highly anticipated sports-drama feature Maidaan in a poster reveal on Tuesday. Ajay, whose recent release Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior is going unfazed at the box office currently, was flooded with congratulatory messages as the new poster of the upcoming film was unveiled. Maidaan is inspired by true story and is directed by Badhaai Ho fame director Amit Sharma. Maidaan will explore the golden era of Indian football between 1952-1962.

 The new poster of Maidaan shows a group of individuals, who are without shoes, standing on a football ground. Their feet are in mud while they seem determined to play even while hardships exist. Sharing the new poster of the upcoming Bollywood film Maidaan, Ajay wrote on social media, Get ready. He also teased that a short footage from the film will debut soon. Maidaan releases on November 27.

 Check it out below:

1633,0,Tamil ,pqr,"Rafael Nadal beat home favourite Nick Kyrgios to storm into the quarterfinals of the Australian Open here on Monday.

 Spaniard Nadal won 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(6), 7-6(4) in front of a packed crowd at the Rod Laver Arena to move one step closer to a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam title.

 It was a very tough match, Nadal told former World No. 1 John McEnroe in an on-court interview as quoted by the ATP Tour website after the match.

 In the beginning I was in control, but youre never in control against Nick. When I made the mistake on serve in the second set, with one serve of mine, it was so difficult to break him again.

 I did the same in the fourth set, but he played a good game. I played a scary game at 5-4, its part of the sport and you have to accept it. I tried to recover mentally for 6-5 and then the tie-break. When he plays like today with a positive attitude, he gives a lot to the sport. Hes one of the best talents on Tour and I like the Nick Kyrgios of this tournament.

 Nadal held serve to love nine times and landed 64 winners to reach his 12th quarter-final at Melbourne Park after three hours and 38 minutes.

 The Spaniard has reached five Australian Open finals.

1634,0,English,xyz,"Former Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka turned back the clock in a vintage performance to stun world number four Daniil Medvedev Monday and race into the Australian Open quarter-finals.

 The popular Swiss star, who beat Rafael Nadal in the 2014 decider, dug deep to come from behind in five intense sets and win 6-2, 2-6, 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 6-2.

 It set up a last-eight clash with either Russian 17th seed Andrey Rublev or German seventh seed Alexander Zverev.

 Another amazing match, said Wawrinka, who is into his 18th Grand Slam quarter-final, behind only Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray among active players. The level was super-high and atmosphere is so special here in Australia.

 Its amazing to still be playing and at that level. Im really happy with what Im doing on the court. Three-time Grand Slam champion Wawrinka has not won a title since pocketing the 16th of his career on the Geneva clay in 2017, with two bouts of surgery on his left knee pushing him to the brink of retirement.

 A lengthy absence from the tour meant his world ranking plunged, but he has climbed back to world number 15 after runs last year to the last eight at Roland Garros and the US Open.

 Beating Medvedev brought up another milestone in Wawrinkas illustrious career -- it was his 300th Tour-level win.

 It was classic Wawrinka in the first set, with the 34-year-old playing some of his best tennis in a long time. He broke to go 3-1 in front and then again to take the set in 32 minutes of precision and power, with the Russian struggling to match him around the court.

 But Medvedev came roaring back to break and take a 3-1 lead in the second set as Wawrinka lost his range, breaking again to take the set in emphatic fashion.

 The 23-year-old built on his advantage early in the third set, with his serve making life hard for Wawrinka who struggled to create chances and had trouble applying the finishing touch at the net.

 “Lakhs of people gather there [Shaheen Bagh],” Verma told ANI. “People of Delhi will have to think and take a decision. They will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them. Today there is time. Tomorrow Modi ji won’t come to save you, Amit Shah won’t come to save you. The people of Delhi are safe only till Modi ji is the prime minister of India.”

 This came a day after Union minister Anurag Thakur had encouraged the audience at a rally to shout an incendiary slogan. Thakur, the minister of state for finance, shouted “desh ke gaddaron ko”, and the crowd responded with “goli maaro saalon ko [shoot the traitors to the country]”.

 On Monday, Verma said Shaheen Bagh protests will be cleared in an hour if the BJP won the Delhi Assembly elections, News18 reported. “If the BJP comes to power in Delhi on February 11, we will clear Shaheen Bagh of all protest and protesters within one hour. Not a single person will be visible,” he said, while addressing a crowd at a community centre in Ranhola village, West Delhi.

 The BJP leader added that within one month all the existing mosques built on government land will be demolished.

 Hundreds of women, along with children, have been peacefully protesting at Shaheen Bagh for almost a month and a half. The police’s attempts to persuade them to leave have failed.

 According to a report in AppleInsider, Foxconn facility in Wuhan could quickly become overrun with an outbreak, potentially putting workers at unnecessary risk and effectively shutting down production.

 In addition to asking many employees to stay at home, the Taiwanese multinational electronics contract manufacturing firm has also enhanced employee health monitoring at the Wuhan factory.

 Foxconn has provided employees with face masks to prevent the spread of the virus. Employees must also have their temperature checked daily, as one of the first symptoms of the illness is a fever, the report said.

 According to Nikkei Asian Review, some five million Chinese jobs rely on Apples presence in the country, including those of more than 1.8 million software and iOS App developers.

 Apple itself employs 10,000 people in China and more than 90 per cent of Apples products are being assembled in China.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook has also tweeted that Apple will donate money to groups on the ground helping to support those affected by the virus.

 As people in China and around the world celebrate the Lunar New Year, we send our love and support to the many impacted by the Coronavirus. Apple will be donating to groups on the ground helping support all of those affected, Cook tweeted.

 Apple has three main businesses in China -- iCloud data centres, retail outlets and a huge manufacturing base.

 Apple Cloud centres are not expected to be heavily impacted but fewer footfalls owing to the virus outbreak at Apple Stores will result in lower sales in the region.

 Apple has no stores in Wuhan and effective from January 27, the tech giant has already reduced operating hours for retails stores across Mainland China.

 Chinese health authorities said on Tuesday that the death toll due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in the country has increased to 106, with 4,515 confirmed cases in 30 provincial-level regions.

 The US has also raised its travel alert for China and recommended that Americans should reconsider travelling to the Asian giant.

 Sarma, also the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convenor, told reporters here that Union Home Minister Amit Shah had clearly said on Monday that if the anti-talk ULFA(I) faction is ready for negotiations, then the Centre is more than willing to hold dialogue with them for the sake of permanent peace in Assam and the Northeast.

 A historic Accord was signed on Monday through discussions with all the factions of the NDFB. The Centre and state government want peace in the region through dialogue, Sarma said, referring to the Bodo pact.

 Most of the militant outfits in the northeastern states, barring some in Assam and Manipur, are holding talks but if we want peace in the region, it should be inclusive by involving all the factions and the outfits, he said.

 The offer comes a few days after ULFA(I) claimed responsibility for four serial blasts in Upper Assam districts on the Republic Day.

1648,0,Gujarati,xyz,"Full-service carrier Vistara may explore opportunities to bid for Air India, according to a report in The Economic Times.

 Vistara is a joint venture between the Tata Sons and Singapore Airlines, where the former is the majority shareholder.

 The airline may consider bidding though a partnership with an investor or another airline, the report added. Moneycontrol could not independently verify the story.

 The government, on January 27, formally began the privatisation process for debt-laden Air India by putting up its entire 100 percent stake up for sale.

 Also read: Heres what IndiGo CEO Ronojoy Dutta told an analyst when asked about interest in Air India

 Tata Sons declined to comment when approached by the newspaper.

 The offer “does not seem worth rejecting”, a source told the publication.

 “There is the emotional goodwill part to it too, considering that it was part of the Tatas initially (before the government nationalised Air India). It is too early though to make any blanket statement,” the source said.

 “We have just received the documents and there are a lot of matters that need detailed consideration in terms of its financial status,” the source added.

 The Tatas had founded Air India in 1932 and owned until it was nationalised in 1953.

 This is the government’s second attempt to divest its stake in Air India. In the first attempt in 2018, it had put up 76 percent of Air India up for sale.

 In this round, the government has offered its entire 100 percent stake in the flag carrier. The Centre has also revised other conditions such as lowering the debt that is to be transferred.

 The new owner of Air India will now be taking on a debt of Rs 23,286 crore as opposed to the earlier Rs 62,000 crore debt.

1649,0,English,xyz,"Abhishek Goenka

 Few people, at this point, would disagree that the government’s finances are terribly strained. Fiscal slippage is imminent. Growth is weak and Central + State + PSU debt as a percentage of GDP is alarmingly high.

 What the market would want to see from the government in the Budget is how transparent and candid it is about the current situation and how committed it is to initiate measures to revive growth.

 The focus sectors of the Budget would be watched closely. Concrete demand-stimulating measures would be received well.

 Well-directed infrastructure spending is the need of the hour, as it will have a cascading impact on demand. An increase in capex as a percentage of total expenditure will be a welcome move.

 Other key focus areas should be agriculture, manufacturing and exports.

 Acknowledging the fact that fiscal slippage was on account of structural reform (cut in corporate tax) and that it could slip in the next couple of years as well in an endeavour to stimulate the economy would augur better than window-dressing numbers and projecting revenue numbers that are far-fetched.

 Overambitious estimates of disinvestment and GST collections would spook markets. Rolling out new schemes without laying down how these would be funded and without elaborating on how they would be executed would not go down well.

 In fact, redirecting expenditure away from schemes that have not worked well towards initiating demand- augmenting measures would be a wise decision.

 It is a delicate balancing act that the FM has to perform between stimulating growth and containing deficit. The mantle of putting the economy back on a firm growth trajectory rests squarely on the government, given that the room for monetary policy accommodation looks limited.

 The governments credibility is at stake and investors, both domestic and global would be watching closely. The last person one would want to be at this point is the FM.

 IFA view on rupee, equities and bonds

 The rupee is consolidating in a broad 70.50-72.50 range. A break in either direction could entail a vertical move in that direction. We expect the Reserve Bank of India to intervene to smoothen volatility.

 The Budget this time is on a Saturday and stock markets will be open that day. For the Nifty, 11,800 is a crucial support, a break of which could convince market participants that a medium-term top is in place.

 On the upside, a break above 12,400 could prove to be the beginning of a fresh leg of a move higher towards 12,800.

 In terms of bond yields, 6.85-6.90 percent is a strong support for the 10-year benchmark bond. On the other hand, 6.42% is a strong resistance. We expect measures to deepen domestic bond markets to be announced in the Budget.

 अरविंद केजरीवाल जी आपने मुझे दिल्ली सरकार द्वारा संचालित स्कूल देखने के लिए बुलाया था। कल दिल्ली भाजपा के आठों सांसद अलग-अलग स्कूल में गए और देखिए इनका क्या हाल है...

 इनकी बदहाली ने आपकी ‘शिक्षा की क्रांति’ के दावों की पोल खोल दी।

 अब आपको दिल्ली की जनता को जवाब देना होगा... pic.twitter.com/gjzgaix2rA

 Directly referring to the Delhi CM, he wrote on his social media handle: “Mr Arvind Kejriwal, since you had asked me to scrutinise government-run schools in Delhi, all eight MPs of Delhi BJP decided to oblige on January 27. However, contrary to your claims, their visit only exposed the deplorable condition of the schools and exposed the truth of your ‘education revolution’. Now you will have to answer the people of Delhi!”

 Amit Shah has been actively criticising the work done by the Aam Admi Party (AAP) to improve the condition of government schools at election rallies. However, this move comes in response to the open challenge thrown at him by Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to show one government-run school in any Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled state that is comparable to the ones in Delhi.

 I invite Amit Shah ji to come visit any Delhi govt school with me. I will cancel all my appointments for him. Politics on education is a positive change, but dirty politics is not welcome. pic.twitter.com/WC3N5oiWyD

1651,0,Gujarati,abc,"Shares of Dr Reddys Laboratories hit more than three-year high intraday on January 28 as brokerage houses remained positive on the stock after strong operating performance in Q3.

 The stock gained as much as 1.5 percent to hit an intraday high of Rs 3,238.15, the highest level since December 2016. It was quoting at Rs 3,229.25, up Rs 40.30, or 1.26 percent on the BSE at 1036 hours IST.

 While having a buy rating on the pharma major, Ambit raised its price target to Rs 3,615 (from Rs 3,217 earlier) as the improved cost base drove 7/15 percent raise in EPS estimates for FY21/22.

 R&D expenses increase will be lower than sales movement in FY21/22 and optimal expenses will boost FY21/22 margin by 140bps/180bps, said the brokerage.

 HSBC also maintained buy call on the stock and raised price target to Rs 3,430 (from Rs 3,230 earlier) as ex-impairment charge, company saw operational improvement in Q3FY20.

 Benefits of new launches and operating leverage reflected in margins. Outlook remains robust for all the focus markets, and US sales growth driven by new launches will be key to watch out for, the brokerage said.

 Dr Reddys Labs on January 27 posted a loss of Rs 569.7 crore for quarter ended December 2019 against profit of Rs 485.2 crore YoY, impacted by impairment loss of Rs 1,320 crore during the quarter.

 The company announced impairment of Rs 1,110 crore on account of womens contraceptive drug Nuvaring generic and Rs 210 crore on intangibles on other products during the quarter. After adjustment for impairment, the profit before tax stood at Rs 790 crore for the quarter.

 The launch of Nuvaring generic has been delayed due to queries from USFDA, which resulted into increasing competition from another generic and authorised generic. Hence, the company decided to took an impairment charge for the drug.

 Revenue during the quarter grew by 13.86 percent year-on-year to Rs 4,384 crore and operating profit jumped 24.1 percent with 200bps YoY margin expansion in Q3.

 Credit Suisse has an outperform call on the stock with a target price of Rs 3,235 as strong EBITDA beat helped by near-term gains, but NuvaRing write-off was higher-than-expected.

 US sales normalised now, aided by market share gains in gSuboxone. Key trigger for the stock is Revlimid generic, where pre-trial is scheduled for June, said the brokerage.

 Revenue from North America, which accounts for 36 percent of total business, grew by 8 percent YoY, and Emerging markets (EMs), which contributes 21 percent to sales, showed a 19 percent YoY growth in Q3.

 India business grew by 13 percent YoY and revenue from Europe rose by 52 percent YoY during the quarter.

 While having equal-weight raing on the stock and raising price target to Rs 3,236 (from Rs 2,804 earlier), Morgan Stanley said efforts to realise operating leverage benefits were showing results and overall business was moving to granular growth against a large product focus previously.

 CLSA has downgraded its rating on the stock to outperform from buy, with a target price of Rs 3,450 per share as companys focus on India/EMs has been delivering, but valuation baked in positives.

 Revenue growth across all geographies was ahead of estimates. The renewed focus on India & EMs has been playing out. It continued to deliver on cost control, the brokerage said, adding future growth in the US hinged on timely approval of gNuvaring and gCopaxone.

 CLSA maintained its FY21-22 EPS estimates but cut FY20 EPS estimates to build in impairment charge. Valuation offers limited room to slip, it feels.

However, the spinner is finding it tough to adjust to the challenges possessed by the red-ball game.Playing Test cricket was always the dream and Im so honoured to have represented my country and province in the longest form of the game. Red-ball cricket is the pinnacle, but also requires a huge amount of time and effort, ESPN Cricinfo quoted Astle as saying.

 As I have got to the back end of my career Ive found it harder to maintain the level of commitment required to be fully invested in this version of the game, he added.

 In his first-class career, he played 119 matches and managed to score 4,345 runs at an average of 25.86. While bowling, the spinner took 334 wickets for Canterbury.

 He is also the highest wicket-taker for Canterbury in first-class cricket.

 Im really proud of what Ive been able to achieve with Canterbury and the Blackcaps. To have the opportunity to play a Test against Australia at the SCG was an experience Ill always cherish, Astle said.

 Im excited to now focus all my energy into the white-ball formats, as well as give more time to my young family and new business, he added. (ANI)

1655,0,English,pqr,"Ash Barty stormed into her maiden Australian Open semi-final on Tuesday with an emphatic 7-6(6), 6-2 win over Petra Kvitova that avenged her defeat to the hard-hitting Czech in the 2019 quarter-final at Melbourne Park. Thrashed 6-1, 6-4 by eventual finalist Kvitova 12 months ago, top seed Barty rode a wave of crowd support as she defused the twice Wimbledon champion`s power game before running away with the contest on a glorious afternoon at Rod Laver Arena.

 It`s been absolutely incredible, I knew I had to bring my absolute best against Petra, Barty said on court. I think Petra, in my eyes, is the perfect competitor. Regardless of whether she wins or loses she`s always got a big grin on her face. I absolutely love testing myself against her.

 French Open champion Barty saved two break points serving for the match, then thumped down four first serves in succession, sealing the win in style with an ace. The 23-year-old became the first Australian woman to reach the semi-finals at Melbourne Park since Wendy Turnbull in 1984.

 She will play 14th seeded American Sofia Kenin, who earlier ended Tunisian Ons Jabeur`s fairytale run, for a place in the final.

 Obviously she`s having an incredible run, she`s really developed her game over the last 12-18 months, Barty said of the Moscow-born Kenin. It`s about me trying to get my running shoes on again. I`m going to have nothing but a massive smile on my face when I walk out here on this beautiful court.

 Australia has not had a home winner at Melbourne Park since Chris O`Neil`s triumph in the women`s tournament in 1978 but the sports-mad nation may feel Barty is poised to break the drought.

 DRIVEN TO DISTRACTION

 Overwhelmed by Kvitova`s firepower in their last meeting in Melbourne -- the Australian`s first appearance in the last eight of a Grand Slam -- a wiser, craftier Barty took the court for the rematch on Tuesday.

 She saved eight out of nine breakpoints to keep Kvitova at bay in the first set, then scrambled brilliantly to claim the tiebreak. Driven to distraction by the Australian`s defense, Kvitova crumbled in the second set. She double-faulted to concede two breakpoints and fell 3-0 behind, having reprieved Barty with a weak overhead smash and another poorly struck volley that pinged the top of the net.

 The volley gave Barty time to swoop forward, and true to her game, she lobbed Kvitova with a deft backhand rather than seek to pass her with needless brawn and aggression. Kvitova belatedly found her range and fired a searing backhand down the line to break back to 4-2 but it was more of a death rattle than a rally.

 The seventh seed dropped serve the next game with a sixth double-fault that put her within a game of defeat. The terraces gasped as Barty fired a forehand just wide to allow Kvitova two chances to break back when serving for the match.

 But soon after they were roaring in delight as Barty struck two aces in a four-point blitz to ensure she will be the talk of the nation through to Thursday`s semi-final.

 According to a report in AppleInsider, Foxconn facility in Wuhan could quickly become overrun with an outbreak, potentially putting workers at unnecessary risk and effectively shutting down production.

 In addition to asking many employees to stay at home, the Taiwanese multinational electronics contract manufacturing firm has also enhanced employee health monitoring at the Wuhan factory.

 Foxconn has provided employees with face masks to prevent the spread of the virus. Employees must also have their temperature checked daily, as one of the first symptoms of the illness is a fever, the report said.

 According to Nikkei Asian Review, some five million Chinese jobs rely on Apples presence in the country, including those of more than 1.8 million software and iOS App developers.

 Apple itself employs 10,000 people in China and more than 90 percent of Apples products are being assembled in China.

 Apple CEO Tim Cook has also tweeted that Apple will donate money to groups on the ground helping to support those affected by the virus.

 As people in China and around the world celebrate the Lunar New Year, we send our love and support to the many impacted by the Coronavirus. Apple will be donating to groups on the ground helping support all of those affected, Cook tweeted.

 Apple has three main businesses in China -- iCloud data centres, retail outlets and a huge manufacturing base.

 Apple Cloud centres are not expected to be heavily impacted but fewer footfalls owing to the virus outbreak at Apple Stores will result in lower sales in the region.

 Apple has no stores in Wuhan and effective from January 27, the tech giant has already reduced operating hours for retails stores across Mainland China.

 Chinese health authorities said on Tuesday that the death toll due to the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in the country has increased to 106, with 4,515 confirmed cases in 30 provincial-level regions.

 The US has also raised its travel alert for China and recommended that Americans should reconsider travelling to the Asian giant.

1658,0,Tamil ,abc,"Procrastination has a bad reputation. Almost all of us are guilty of being procrastinators at some point in our lives. We put off tasks, and we hate ourselves for doing so. However, can procrastination have any benefits? Or is it truly the monster we make it out to be?

 Procrastination is the intentional delay in starting or finishing a task, despite being aware of the negative consequences it may incur. Usually, when you procrastinate, you find yourself doing trivial activities instead of the task that you are supposed to. For example, you might find yourself cleaning your room to avoid writing an assignment. People who procrastinate also often find themselves working at the last-minute, and rushing to meet deadlines. The stress and panic that procrastination causes gives it a bad reputation. However, there are also some surprising benefits to procrastination.

 While you are putting off a task, your subconscious may be still thinking of it. This can lead to an innovative or creative idea or a new way of doing your work. Delaying your work can mean you have more time to think about a creative way of doing it. It can also give you a more efficient solution. When you finally get to down to do the task, it is only after your subconscious has had the time to mull over it.

 Also Read: Eight Effective Ways To Keep Yourself Productive

 In today’s changing times, nothing is constant. A task you were assigned might not have to be carried out, eventually. If you jump on every task as soon as it comes, you might find yourself doing things that didn’t have to be done. The feeling of working hard on something only to be told that it isn’t needed is heart-wrenching. Waiting for a while means that when you do work, every bit counts.

 Spending an entire week over a task while giving yourself no time to relax is one way to work. If you’re a procrastinator, though, you probably finished it in one day. What this means is that you have more time to do things you like to. Ultimately, if you had fun and finished your work as well, that’s what matters. So if you’re hanging out with your friends all day, but still finishing your project in the evening and sending it in by the deadline, then you get the best of both worlds.

 When you’re procrastinating, it gives you the time to prioritise. Many people are unable to prioritize but as a procrastinator, you must. Prioritisation is an essential skill that helps you focus on what’s most important and work from there. This is helpful to get rid of unnecessary tasks, things you might have begun that weren’t worth your time, at least now. You can feel more productive this way.

 Also Read: Five Ways To Avoid Burnout Yet Stay Productive

 When you procrastinate, it is usually on a tedious or boring task. You don’t have the energy or the bandwidth for it. However, a looming deadline brings with it a boost of energy. Procrastination’s (or rather a deadline’s) natural consequence is heightened adrenaline as it comes down to the last minute to get the work done. Adrenaline is known to increase focus and makes boring tasks tolerable too.

 Mr Martin Schwenk, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer at Mercedes-Benz India said, At Auto Expo 2020, beside launching the AMG GT 4 Door Coupe, unveiling the A-Class Limousine and the New GLA SUV, we also will be launching something unique and never seen before in India.

 Inspired by the success of the V-Class Luxury MPV in India, we will be launching the V-Class Marco Polo Camper. Nothing reflects restlessness and a spirit of adventure better than an exciting road-trip and camping, he added.

 Mercedes-Benz says the V-Class Marco Polo embodies these traits, and blends outdoor ruggedness with the companys world-renowned luxury and technology. Merc expects that the V-Class Marco Polo camper to generate a lot of interest among their existing customers, who already have shown a massive interest to the V-Class luxury MPV models.

 There is no concrete information about features and specification at the moment. The Mercedes-Benz V-Class Marco Polo is currently available in international markets and has been named after the explorer Marco Polo.

 The Marco Polo available in foreign markets feature front seats that swivel, and rear seats that fold flat to make for a bed. The vehicle also features a pop-up roof that reveals an ‘upstairs sleeping space.

 The V-Class Marco Polo features built in wardrobes, drawers, a stove, a sink with fresh and waste water tanks, and a fridge among a host of other elements that make it a mobile home.

 Safety features on the Mercedes-Benz V-Class Marco Polo include brake assist, front and side impact beams, a crash sensor, a centrally mounted fuel tank, attention assist, and hill assist among others.

 Thoughts About The Mercedes-Benz V-Class Marco Polo Launching In India

 Camper-style travel is not an Indian thing. Most folk only use a vehicle to get from place A to B, and live out of hotel or resorts, not their vehicles. While the concept is great, we think India is better off with seven, eight, and nine seater vehicles rather than campers.

 The petrol now costs Rs 73.60 a litre in Delhi, Rs 79.21 a litre in Mumbai, Rs 76.22 a litre in Kolkata and Rs 76.44 a litre in Chennai after the price cut.

 Similarly, diesel costs Rs 66.58 a litre in Delhi, Rs 69.79 a litre in Mumbai, Rs 68.94 per litre in Kolkata and Rs 70.33 a litre in Chennai, according to the Indian Oil Corporation website.  The rising number of coronavirus cases and lockdown of several cities in China have impacted crude demand in that country. China is the second largest consumer of crude oil.  Petrol and diesel prices in India might fall further in the coming days as people are restricting their travel plans to China leading to decrease in demand.  The retail prices of fuel are dependent on the international crude prices and the rupee-US dollar exchange rate as India imports almost 80 per cent of its crude requirements. Domestic petrol and diesel prices are reviewed by oil marketing companies on a daily basis. Price revisions are implemented at the fuel stations with effect from 6 a.m.

1668,0,Tamil ,xyz,"‘Shaheen Bagh Protesters Will Enter Homes, Rape & Kill’: BJP MP

 SHARE, SAVE, COMMENT

 Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Member of Parliament from West Delhi Parvesh Verma on Tuesday, 28 January, suggested that the largely peaceful anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act protesters at Shaheen Bagh will enter the homes of Delhi’s residents, rape and kill their sisters and daughters.

 Drawing a contrived comparison with the atrocities faced by Kashmiri Pandits and unspecified incidents in Kerala and Uttar Pradesh, the MP said:

 “This fire can reach Delhi’s homes at any time. Delhi’s residents will have to decide carefully. These people will enter your homes, pick up your sisters and daughters, rape them and kill them.”

 “Tomorrow Modi wont come and save you, nor will Amit Shah. Theres still time. If Delhi’s people come to their senses soon, it will be good,” he added.

 ‘If BJP Comes to Power, It’ll Disperse Protesters in an Hour, Not Spare Mosques Built on Govt Land’

 The BJP MP also claimed that Shaheen Bagh will be cleared within an hour – and mosques built on government land razed within a month – if the BJP comes to power in Delhi.

 “This is not just another election. It is an election to decide the unity of a nation. If the BJP comes to power on 11 February, you will not find a single protester within an hour. And within a month, we will not spare a single mosque built on government land.”

 Parvesh Sahib Singh Verma, BJP MP

 Verma had, in August last year, claimed that mosques and graveyards were mushrooming on government land in the city.

 A fact-finding committee of the Delhi Minorities Commission promptly disproved his claim and recommended registration of an FIR against him for allegedly making false claims, spreading rumours to target a particular community and disturbing communal harmony in Delhi.

 ‘Desh Ke Gaddaron Ko...’ And Other Provocative Statements by BJP Leaders

 Verma is not the first BJP leader to put anti-CAA protesters in the crosshairs in the run-up to the Delhi Assembly elections.

 On Saturday, 25 January, addressing a gathering of BJP’s social media volunteers in the national capital, Home Minister Amit Shah urged people to vote for the saffron party so that there is “no Shaheen Bagh” in Delhi.

 “Press the button of lotus so hard that the current makes the Shaheen Bagh protesters run away on the very evening of 8 February,” he said.

 The chief electoral officer of Delhi has sought a report from the returning officer of Rithala constituency over the BJP minister’s speech.

 Meanwhile, on Friday, Delhi Police lodged an FIR against BJP candidate Kapil Mishra in connection with his controversial tweet in which he likened the election in the city to an India versus Pakistan contest, sources said.

 The episode began with Abir, Kunal, and Nishant talking about Mishti and her situation. Nishant said Mishti cannot put too much time into the matter as it was her wedding the next day. Abir got a phone call and the person asked where he is. Nishant said they were outside Rajvansh Sadan. Abir went and checked on Mishti.

 Meenakshi went to Nishant and asked what was it that he wanted. He said that Abir and Mishti were drifting away again. Mishti asked what option had he left for her. She flipped out on him and said that he had taken too long to express his feelings. She took a stool and got on top of it to corner him. She said that she had seen through his feelings a while back. However, he did not make a move or leave her a choice. Abir apologised while Mishti was still telling him where he went wrong.

 Meenakshi told Nishant that he was supposed to be on time. Nishant said that she and her family do not deserve Mishti. His family would have never insulted her the way they did. He also asked for assurance that there will be no issues during the wedding ceremony.

 Meenakshi replied by saying that there were a few things beyond her control. She told him that if he followed her directions, things would come to an end between Abir and Mishti. She made him promise that he would disappear with Mishti once Abir was out of the picture. On the other hand, Mishti told Abir how complicated the situation was. Abir asked her to not leave him as he accepted that it was his fault.

 Abir told Mishti that he would fix everything. However, he was confused about Nishant as he was family. A misunderstanding occurred about Nishant not telling Mishti. At this point, Abir thought to himself how he cannot tell the truth as Nishant was her friend. Abir asked her to go home and told her he will fix everything.

 The next morning, Parul got prasad for Abir and told him how Kunal was upset that Nishants truth did not get revealed. Abir admitted that Nishant had feelings for Mishti. They asked him to be careful of Nishant. He sought everyones blessings in the house.

 At the Haldi ceremony, Kunal told Mishti that in the end, the right things would happen. Abir entered and everyone was fascinated to see him. Mishti had a flashback moment.

The word ‘Basant’ denotes spring and ‘Panchami’ means the fifth day of the Maagh month. Also, known as Saraswati Puja, the day is considered pious to introduce kids to reading and writing as Saraswati is known to be the goddess of wisdom and knowledge. Basant Panchami marks the beginning of spring season and that is the reason, there is a great importance of colour yellow on the occasion. On Saraswati Puja, people in India wear colourful clothes and prepare traditional food in yellow hues as the colour symbolises light, prosperity, optimism, and energy. Here, we tell you about some colourful delicacies that you can prepare on this auspicious occasion.

 It is one of the go-to sweets in India. Boondi Ladoo is prepared on almost every occasion for the offerings. Due to its yellow colour, the sweet is considered the symbol of spirit on Saraswati Puja. To prepare Boondi Ladoo, you firstly need to pour besan into hot oil through a perforated ladle. After the besan droplets are deep-fried, soak them into the sugar syrup. Now is the time to mold them into Ladoos.

 Also known as Kesari Chawal, Meethe Chawal is a special recipe in Punjabi households during Basant Panchami. The dish is prepared by boiling rice and then putting it in the sugar syrup. Also, spices like cinnamon, cardamom, Kesar, and cloves are added into it to give Metthe Chawal, a fragrant flavour. At last, you can also add saffron to give the dish a nice hue.

 This traditional Bengali sweet is prepared with ingredients like paneer, almonds, and pistachios. Also, you can add saffron and cardamom powder in it. Its distinct yellow colour makes Rajbhog, a perfect sweet for Basant Panchami or Saraswati Puja celebration.

1676,0,Hindi,xyz,"Bengaluru: The crucial meeting between senior Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Siddaramaiah ahead of the selection of the new Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president at a private hotel on Sunday raised many eyebrows.

 According to sources, several key issues regarding names for KPCC president post and whether the posts of Congress Legislature Party (CLP) and leader of Opposition (LoP) should be held by one person, were discussed.

 With the likes of former deputy chief minister G Parameshwara, a few Congress leaders have been vocal in their opposition to the same leader holding the posts of CLP and LoP.

 However, Siddaramaiah has remained adamant and maintained that both the constitutional posts should be held by the same individual.

 For months now, confusion has prevailed over the posts of CLP, LoP and KPCC president and factions have risen within the party between long standing and migrant Congressmen. Since then, lobbying has intensified within the party and it has also become a hotbed for politics as leaders are voicing out their opinions openly.

 On the backdrop of recent developments, the high command has urged the state leaders to show some solidarity. Leaders who held talks with Dinesh Gundu Rao reportedly told him that factional politics is tarnishing the party’s image.

 According to sources, the leaders have instructed Congress leaders to refrain from making unwarranted statements and also maintain solidarity within the party.

 Speaking to media, Mallikarjun Kharge said, “We (Siddaramaiah and I) just had breakfast on Sunday and did not discuss anything regarding politics. We didn’t discuss anything else as it was just a breakfast meet after Republic day celebrations.”

 Reports that Cipla and Asian buyout fund PAG are looking to acquire a big chunk of pharmaceutical major Wockhardts domestic formulation business are picking up steam. Habil F Khorakiwala, founder, chairman and group CEO of Wockhardt, spoke to CNBC-TV18 about the developments at the company.

 On reports of the impending sale, he said: “I would not like to comment on the media speculation but the fact is that we are looking to raise some equity and cash through some kind of restructuring of the organisation.”

 On the question of a timeline for the restructuring, Khoarkiwala said: “It would be rather soon in next month or so.”

 He revealed that sales are picking up in comparison to the previous quarter. “This quarter our sales are up compared to previous quarter by about 9-10 percent. Secondly, we have been managing our expenses over last 9-12 months and that has also shown a significant reduction in our cost of operation. That is how we have become fit and trim and that is something which would be very sustainable. Our margins for the quarter is among the highest we had in recent times at 17.7 percent as a result of our product mix primarily. Last quarter it was 12.8 percent and last year same quarter it was 9.4 percent. So there is a very significant increase in our EBITDA.

 “We want to do this restructuring once so that we are comfortable for next few years to build our business on one hand and invest in research what is necessary.

 He also divulged details about Wockhardts Waluj plant. “We have completed most of remediation measures and we are in communication with USFDA [the US Food and Drug Administration] and there are certain additional information USFDA is requiring which we are providing and we hope that during the coming financial year, there will be an inspection early enough and we hope that we should be back on track as far as USFDA is concerned and US business is concerned.”

 On India business, he said: “India business has three components, one is our branded business which is not down very significantly — it is down by less than single digit. The generic business that we had, more or less we have discontinued that and that is also showing a decline. Third element was some Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) business domestically is down but internationally it is up.

1678,0,Telugu,xyz,"A number of studies, including by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), find that sea levels are positively correlated with surface temperatures, which themselves are linked to global emissions of greenhouse gases.

 There is no one-to-one correspondence between carbon emissions, temperature increases and sea-level rise. But there is very broad consensus and, according to the IPCC, high confidence that the pace of global mean sea-level rise will steepen markedly in the second half of this century.

 An update by the IPCC released in September 2019 projects sea levels to rise 0.4-0.8 meters on average by 2100 relative to 1986-2005, based on various emission scenarios, marking annual increases that range between 4-15 millimeters.

 Sea level rise is among the major trend manifestations of human-induced climate change, which is accompanied by shocks such as storm surges, flooding and land subsidence.

 Global sea levels have been rising for the past century, a result of meltwater from glaciers and ice sheets, and expansion of seawater as it warms. Since satellite records began in 1993, the average rate of sea-level increase has been 3.2 millimeters per year.

 As temperatures continue to climb, the pace of sea-level rise is likely to accelerate, resulting in significant social and economic costs for some countries.

 Given the lagged impact of emissions on ocean warming, even if emissions were reduced to zero today, sea levels would continue to rise well into the future.

 We have been talking about how climate change impacts not only the individuals but can scuttle the operations or slow sales of the companies. Moody’s has now cautioned investors on the impact of rising sea levels on a number of sovereigns.

 The report says that Asia, Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and small islands are the most exposed to rising sea levels. And in absolute terms, the largest populations exposed are in Bangladesh, China, Indonesia and India.

 Through their assessment of exposure and credit impact, we find that Vietnam, Egypt, Suriname and a number of small islands face material credit risk. The extent of risk will be determined by the pace of increase in the frequency and severity of natural disasters related to sea-level rise, which is currently highly uncertain, and by the effectiveness of adaptation measures, so far largely untested.

 The report talks about the impact on the economy:

 -              Loss of Income

 For countries with a sizeable proportion of land and population at risk of submersion, sea-level rise will lead to relative income loss as a trend when coastal economic activity is no longer possible, and through shocks when cyclones, floods and other severe weather events interrupt output. Gradual trends and repeated shocks will curb investment and potential growth, and raise economic volatility.

 This will hurt the economic strength of these sovereigns, in the absence of offsetting positive economic changes. The impact on economic strength is likely to materialize through several areas of economic activity

 -              Tourism

 Over time, coastal erosion or concerns about natural disasters may make some regions less attractive to tourists. For a number of small-island sovereigns, such as the Bahamas, Belize, Fiji or Maldives, tourism is a driver of economic activity, band a major source of export revenue and foreign exchange.

 -              Trade

 Trade Coastal cities are often densely populated and serve as ports and nodes for regional and global supply chains and trade. Several ports in Asia are particularly exposed to sea level rise. A significant hit to the tourism sector or a long-lasting shock to exports could also raise external vulnerability risk.

 -              Damage to infrastructure and assets

 Sea level rise and its associated effects have the potential to damage assets, including infrastructure, buildings and vehicles. The consequences would materialise on a sovereigns fiscal strength, and likely also impair economic strength.

 -              Social implications

 Sea level rise also has social implications, mainly through loss of life, and additionally its impact on health and migration. Such social considerations can hurt economic strength, via growth rates and per-capita income

Citing Kashmir, he said that young children are being radicalised. Furthermore, stated that even Pakistan has started de-radicalisation camps.

 Earlier in the day, General Bipin Rawat said, To say that radicalisation cannot be countered, I don’t agree with this. Anything that has started can be put to an end. Radicalisation can be countered. You have to start looking at where the radicalisation is happening. And who are the people who are radicalising these people. It is happening in schools, universities, religious places and sites, and there are a group of people who are spreading this.

 Like what we are seeing in Kashmir… we saw radicalisation happening. Today we are seeing radicalisation being undertaken even among young people. Girls and boys as young as 12 are now being radicalised. These people can still be isolated from radicalisation in a gradual way. But there are people who have completely been radicalised. These people need to be taken out separately, possibly taken into some de-radicalisation camps. We have de-radicalisation camps going on in our country. Let me tell you, even Pakistan is doing the same. Pakistan also has de-radicalisation camps. They have understood that some of the terrorism that they have been sponsoring is actually hitting back at them, the CDS added.

Considering the fact that Friday was anyways low at 2.70 crores, this isn’t a kind of fall that was expected.

 The film has collected 16.56 crores so far and the first week would now close in the vicinity of 20 crores. Ideally, this should have been the opening weekend collections of the Ashwini Iyer Tiwary directed film. The irony is that this one is actually a good entertainer but due to various reasons (especially the clash with two biggies – Street Dancer 3D and Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior), the footfalls have been distributed.

 Nonetheless, one now expects the film to find better traction on the digital platform. Such genre of films manage to gain footfalls when premiered for the small screen and considering the fact that Panga has seen appreciation for the content, that should turn out to be the case.

 Washington D.C: A new study led by researchers found that children who had been exposed to cyberbullying had significantly greater severity of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than those who had not been subjected to the same.

 Cyberbullying has a great impact on triggering symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression in young people who were inpatients at an adolescent psychiatric hospital.

 Also Read: Bullying hurts both Victims and perpetrators

 The co-author of the paper, Dr. Philip D. Harvey said, Even against a backdrop of emotional challenges in the kids we studied, we noted cyberbullying had an adverse impact. Its real and should be assessed. Cyberbullying is possibly more pernicious than other forms of bullying because of its reach.

 The study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry suggested that children who have a history of being abused were more likely to be cyberbullied. This leads to the take that, assessments for childhood trauma should also be included while assessing cyberbullying.

 Likewise, children who report being cyberbullied should be assessed for a history of childhood trauma.

 Dr. Harvey further continued, The bullying can be viral and persistent. To really be bullying, it has to be personal - a directly negative comment attempting to make the person feel bad.

 A detailed study on cyberbullying confirmed some of the major facts of cyberbullying, that includes being regularly online on social media werent the factors of cyberbullying. The major stress was on the fact that adolescents who have been bullied in the past had a higher risk of being bullied again

 The study was conducted at a suburban psychiatric hospital in Westchester County, New York, asked participants to complete two childhood trauma questionnaires and a cyberbullying questionnaire.

 The result showed that twenty per cent of participants were cyberbullied within the last two months before their admission. Half of the participants were bullied by text messages and a half on Facebook. Transmitted pictures or videos, Instagram, instant messages and chat rooms were other cyberbullying vehicles.

 The results led Dr Harvey to encourage psychologists, psychiatrists, and other counsellors to frequently ask young people if they were abused or traumatised when they were younger. (ANI)

 SHARE, SAVE, COMMENT

 NBA superstar LeBron James said on Monday he was heartbroken and devastated over the death of Kobe Bryant while vowing in an Instagram post to continue Bryants championship legacy with the Los Angeles Lakers.

 Bryant, a five-time NBA champion in 20 seasons with the Lakers, died on Sunday at the age of 41 in a helicopter crash only hours after Lakers star James overtook him for the third spot on the leagues all-time scoring list.

 James also made it clear he is still trying to process the shocking death of an iconic long-time rival and dear friend long before they had expected to say farewell, the crash having killed nine people in all, including Bryants daughter Gigi.

 The Lakers have won 16 NBA titles in team history, one shy of the Boston Celtics all-time record. Bryant won five titles in seven NBA Finals appearances, taking crowns in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010.

 But the Lakers have suffered six consecutive losing seasons since their last play-off appearance, including the final three campaigns of Bryants career.

 This season, the Lakers have the second-best record in the NBA at 36-10 to lead the Western Conference, with James averaging 25.3 points, 7.7 rebounds and a league-best 10.7 assists a game.

1697,0,Tamil ,pqr,"Panga Box Office Day 4: Kangana Ranaut starrer saw a drop in collections as just 1.65 crores came on Monday. Considering the fact that Friday was anyways low at 2.70 crores, this isn’t a kind of fall that was expected. As a matter of fact the bare minimum requirement for the film was to maintain at least Friday levels during the weekdays and that would have allowed at least 10 crores more to be accumulated before the second weekend. However, that hasn’t quite turned out to be the case.

 The film has collected 16.56 crores so far and the first week would now close in the vicinity of 20 crores. Ideally, this should have been the opening weekend collections of the Ashwini Iyer Tiwary directed film. The irony is that this one is actually a good entertainer but due to various reasons (especially the clash with two biggies – Street Dancer 3D and Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior), the footfalls have been distributed.

 Nonetheless, one now expects the film to find better traction on the digital platform. Such genre of films manage to gain footfalls when premiered for the small screen and considering the fact that Panga has seen appreciation for the content, that should turn out to be the case. However, theatrical business will stay sub optimal.

 Blunt starred opposite husband John Krasinski, who also directed the film. She was not only taken aback by how popular the film proved to be, but also how much conversation it sparked off over theories surrounding deeper themes, reports femalefirst.co.uk.

 She said: “I was gobsmacked. Not only by just how many people went to see it and then told their friends to see it, and then it had this meteoric life that was not expected by me. But also the very deep metaphorical themes that people pulled out of it, some of which were intended and some of which really weren’t. They found it really involving and exciting.”

 Now the couple is ready with a sequel of the film, although they resisted the idea initially.

 “I wrote the first one to be one thing, and then when it did well and (the studio) were like, ‘We’re going to do a sequel’, I thought, ‘Great. Go find someone else. It’ll be great. Enjoy it’,” said Krasinski.

 Blunt added to Total Film magazine: “We were aware that the studio was probably going to make a sequel, with or without us.”

 Avast, a company that makes free antivirus software, which is used by over 435 million users around the globe, has reportedly been selling the web browsing data of its users.

 According to an investigation by Motherboard and PCMag, Avast was using a subsidiary company called Jumpshot to sell highly sensitive web browsing data of its users.

 The software was apparently tracking and data from Google and Google Maps searches, LinkedIn pages, YouTube videos, and porn websites. This data was then shared on Jumpshot, which eventually sold the data.

 In a recent press release, Jumpshot revealed that it has data from 100 million devices.

 Representational Image.

 In a statement given to CNet, an Avast spokesperson said that Jumpshot doesnt acquire personal identification information, including name, email address or contact details, and that users have always had the option to opt-out of sharing data with Jumpshot.

 As of July 2019, we had already begun implementing an explicit opt-in choice for all new downloads of our AV, and we are now also prompting our existing free users to make an opt-in or opt-out choice, a process which will be completed in February 2020, the spokesperson said.

 Even if the company data does not acquire personal information as it claims, it still has information on specific browsing data, which could be used to deanonymise users.

 In a statement to Motherboard and PCMag, Avast said that it doesnt anymore share browsing data with Jumpshot:

 Until recently, Avast was collecting the browsing data of its customers who had installed the companys browser plugin, which is designed to warn users of suspicious websites. Security researcher and AdBlock Plus creator Wladimir Palant published a blog post in October showing that Avast harvest user data with that plugin. Shortly after, browser makers Mozilla, Opera, and Google removed Avasts and subsidiary AVGs extensions from their respective browser extension stores. Avast had previously explained this data collection and sharing in a blog and forum post in 2015. Avast has since stopped sending browsing data collected by these extensions to Jumpshot, Avast said in a statement to Motherboard and PCMag.

 However, the report found that the companys claims were false and that the data collection is ongoing. Instead of harvesting information through software attached to the browser, Avast is doing it through the anti-virus software itself.

 It was reportedly found that Avast has recently started asking users to opt-in to data collection via a pop-up message in the antivirus software. However, multiple users told Motherboard they were unaware that their browsing data was then sold.

1702,0,Gujarati,pqr,"The RS’ 1.0-litre, turbo-petrol engine is unlikely to continue into the BS6 era owing to low sales volumes.

 With just a few months left for mandatory BS6 regulations to kick in, Maruti Suzuki has pulled the plug on the Baleno RS. The souped-up hatchback has been discontinued in its BS4 avatar and owing to limited success, the model is unlikely to see a BS6 upgrade.

 The Baleno RS was first introduced as a sporty iteration of the premium hatch in early 2017. It packed in a 1.0-litre, three-cylinder, turbo-petrol unit from the carmaker’s Boosterjet family of engines and was tuned to produce 102hp and 150Nm of torque. The step-up in performance over the 83hp, 1.2-litre petrol and 90hp, 1.2-litre petrol mild-hybrid engines of the standard Baleno meant that the RS could complete the sprint from 0-100kph in just over 10sec. However, the added oomph did translate into slightly lower fuel economy figures. The hot hatch came with a 5-speed manual gearbox as standard.

 In terms of design, the RS closely resembled the standard hatchback, save for the mesh front grille, reworked front and rear bumpers, restyled alloy wheels and all-black fabric upholstery. It was available in a single, fully-loaded trim that matched the top-spec Baleno Alpha in equipment levels. As such, it featured dual front airbags, ABS, Isofix child seat mounts, rear parking sensors and camera, 7.0-inch touchscreen with smartphone connectivity, automatic air conditioning and auto LED projector headlamps with DRLs.

 The sporty Baleno received a mild facelift in early 2019 and was priced at Rs 8.89 lakh. However, low sales compelled the company to slash prices to Rs 7.89 lakh in the subsequent months, which reduced the price increment over the range-topping Alpha petrol-manual to just Rs 31,000. Maruti was further offering discounts of up to Rs 75,000 to clear stocks of the Baleno RS in December last year.

 In a fate similar to the RS’ engine, the 75hp, 1.3-litre diesel engine of the standard Baleno is also slated to get axed from the line-up in the near future, following Maruti Suzuki’s decision to exit the diesel market completely. That will leave the premium hatch with just the pair of 1.2-litre petrol engines that have been BS6-compliant since April last year.

 This also marks Maruti’s exit from the small turbo-petrol engine category, with the automaker finding it a challenge to market them in India.

1703,0,Telugu,xyz,"The industrial output in December is once again expected to contract after a marginal recovery in the previous month. In the three months to October, India’s industrial output consecutively shrank on the back of slow economic growth. “Based on the weaker performance of the manufacturing sectors and non-oil exports, we expect the Index of Industrial Production to revert to a mild contraction in December 2019 from the modest growth in November 2019,” said credit rating agency ICRA in its report. However, it also said that the contraction of the core sector industries is likely to narrow further in December 2019, benefitting from the improvement in coal and electricity, which would offset the deterioration in crude oil and refinery output.

 Partly driven by an unfavourable base effect, as much as 11 out of 18 economic indicators recorded a deterioration in the month of December, compared to the previous months. The waning of the favourable base effects was observed in indicators such as crude oil production, non-oil exports, passengers carried by domestic airlines, and consumption of ATF, diesel, and petrol.

 Among these indicators, the performance of crude oil production was mainly affected. The crude oil production has reportedly worsened to 7.4 per cent in December 2019 from 6 per cent in the previous month. Also, the refinery output contracted by 1 per cent in December 2019, compared to 3.8 per cent growth in November 2019.

 On the brighter side, the growth in seven of the lead indicators such as the production of commercial vehicles, Coal India Limited (CIL), bank deposits as well as traffic-related to ports cargo and railway freight, displayed a sequential improvement in December 2019. The Indian economy has been going through a phase of a prolonged slowdown in recent months, however, signs of early recovery have started to appear as the rural part of the country has started to regain the lost momentum.

1704,0,Gujarati,pqr,"US aerospace giant Boeing has identified India as one of its top markets and critical to its international growth plans, eyeing the country’s plans to buy fighter jets worth billions of dollars. The statement of Dennis Swanson, vice president, International Sales, Boeing Global Sales and Marketing came ahead of his visit to India’s mega defence exhibition to be held in Lucknow from February 5-9. In April, the Indian Air Force issued an initial tender to acquire 114 jets at a cost of around USD 18 billion, billed as one of the world’s biggest military procurement in recent years.

 The top contenders for the deal include Lockheed’s F-21, Boeing’s F/A-18, Dassault Aviation’s Rafale, the Eurofighter Typhoon, Russian aircraft Mig 35 and Saab’s Gripen. “India is one of the top markets for Boeing and critical to our international growth plans. As one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, India offers growth and productivity opportunities, as well as talent and technology innovation advantages,” Swanson told PTI on Monday.

 Boeing has established a growing defence installation base, invested in manufacturing, skill development and engineering in India, and contributed to developing the aerospace and defence ecosystem that is being built on technology advancement and innovation, said Swanson, who is co-leading a high-powered delegation of US India Business Council to ‘DefExpo 2020’ along with David Sutton, director for the Indo-Pacific, Lockheed Martin International. Over 1,000 companies from nearly 70 countries will take part in the biggest-ever DefExpo to be held in Lucknow from February 5-9, according to a Defence Ministry statement in New Delhi.

 Responding to a question on India’s multi-billion fighter jet acquisition deal, Swanson said that Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet is the latest Block III configuration that offers India the latest technologies and capabilities. “Our F/A-18 Super Hornet Block III offers the Indian Navy a unique and differentiated capability in the form of an advanced, combat-proven, multi-role naval fighter that is fully compatible with the Indian Navy carriers and would boost the growing maritime and defence relationship between the US and India,” he said.

 Designed as a carrier-based fighter for high-loading, high-stress operations with minimal support equipment required, the Super Hornet Block III is fully compliant with and ideally suited for the Indian Navy’s carrier deck, and as demonstrated in flight trials, it can take off from Indian aircraft carriers via ski jump. It is also compatible with air refuelling tankers operated around the world, Swanson said. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh in December visited Naval Air Station Oceana on the invitation of the US government and toured the F/A-18 squadron and sat in an aircraft.

 With the Super Hornet being the frontline fighter for the US Navy, cooperation between the two navies in naval aviation can result in the sharing of upgrades and knowledge, Swanson said. The F/A-18 can unlock the potential of cooperation in naval aviation, with the sharing of best practices in modern naval aviation systems, carrier integration know-how, services and training and weapon systems, he said.

 In addition, the F/A-18’s integration with Indian carriers would demonstrate India’s commitment as a ‘Major Defence Partner’ and the ‘Asia Pacific Reassurance Initiative’, serving as an important symbol of the new relationship between the US and India, he asserted. Boeing, he said, has a long-standing partnership with the Indian armed forces, with the C-17, Apache, Chinook and P-8I aircraft playing an important role in mission-readiness for the Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy.

 With a supply chain of over 200 partners in India, and a joint venture with Tata that is manufacturing fuselages for Apache helicopters in Hyderabad, Boeing is partnering with Indian industry to grow the indigenous aerospace industry in the country, he said. According to Swanson, over USD 1 billion of products and services sourced from India go into the most advanced Boeing aircraft across its commercial and defence businesses.

 “While we have quadrupled sourcing from India in the last five years, we are also investing in talent, training and skill development now and for the future,” he said. Boeing currently employs 3,500 people in India, and more than 7,000 people work with its supply chain partners, he said, noting that the company overall makes an impact on more than 1,50,000 lives.

 Swanson said Boeing’s research and development (R&D) presence in India includes partnerships with research partners in academia, research laboratories and industry – including IITs, IISC, and the Department of Science and Technology. It supports aerospace research and co-development of technologies in India to address future technical challenges in aerospace. The US company has established a Boeing Research & Technology India (BIETC) center that conducts research in areas such as flight sciences, materials and processes, and structures and software with Indian research partners.

 BIETC in Bengaluru and Chennai growing rapidly and is expected to employ 4,000 engineers by this year, he said. “Our engineers undertaking complex aerospace work to support diverse areas across the local and international ecosystem. They also perform engineering activities in the areas of mechanical, electrical and electronic engineering for current and future aircraft,” Swanson added.

1705,0,Gujarati,xyz,"The Jharkhand government under Chief Minister Hemant Soren is likely to undertake its first expansion on Tuesday, with as many as eight new ministers set to be inducted into the council of ministers. The swearing-in ceremony of the new ministers is scheduled to be held at 4 PM at the Raj Bhavan in Jharkhand’s capital city of Ranchi.

 The Soren-led Jharkhand Mukti Morcha is expected to get the lion’s share with as many as five ministers likely to be from the party. Two other ministers are expected to be administered oath from the Congress party. The JMM and the Congress had contested elections in an alliance which also had the Rashtriya Janata Dal as a constituent. Two Congress leaders and the lone RJD MLA have already been given ministerial berths. Jharkhand can have a maximum of 12 ministers including the Chief Minister.

 Soren had taken oath as the Jharkhand Chief Minister on December 29. Three other MLAs — Alamgir Alam and Rameshwar Oraon from Congress and Satyanand Bhokta of the RJD– had taken oath along with him. JMM, which does not have an MLA from his party in the Cabinet yet, had appointed Ravindra Nath Mahto as the Speaker of the Jharkhand Legislative Assembly.

 The oath ceremony, which was earlier scheduled for January 24, was deferred in view of the killings of seven tribal men in Chaibasa. CM Hemant Soren, who visited the bereaved families, met the Governor upon his return and requested that the expansion be deferred. However, some reports suggest that the Cabinet expansion had to be delayed as the Congress failed to decide its choice of MLAs to be appointed as ministers in time.

 Among names of Congress MLAs doing the rounds as likely ministers include Rajendra Singh, Deepika Pandey and Banna Gupta. From the JMM quota, names likely to be inducted as ministers include Stephen Marandi, Champai Soren, Haji Hussain Ansari, Joba Manjhi, Jagannath Mahto, Deepak Birua and Mathura Prasad Mahto.

 As many as 436 people who have returned from China, mainly the Wuhan province, are under observation in Kerala for suspected exposure to the novel coronavirus. Of them, five are in isolation wards and others have been quarantined at home.

 A state health department official said 148 persons were put under observation on Monday, taking the total figure to 436. “The number of people under observation can go up in the coming days if the return of Keralites from China continue. So far, no one has tested positive. We had sent six samples to the virology lab in Pune, but all of them tested negative. Tomorrow, we are sending a few more samples,’’ official said.

 Stating that the situation is under control at present, the official said, “We have to be realistic, especially after a positive case was confirmed in Nepal. We fear such a possibility and the department is fully prepared to meet such an eventuality,” he said.

 Health department sources said a major chunk of those who have been put under observation was directly picked up from airports after they returned from China. “They are students and business travellers. A section of them have reported at hospitals days after landing in Kerala following the alert issued by the health department.’’

 The health department has arranged isolation wards in all 14 districts. Those under home quarantine would be monitored by the primary health centres in the region. They would be under watch for 28 days. Health staff would be in touch with them at regular intervals on a day.

 In a setback to the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation, the Jaypee Group, which had agreed to hand over the garbage processing plant to the civic body, has backed out saying that they were not aware of any such agreement.

 In a meeting held here between the two parties, which was attended by the Jaypee Group representatives, the Mayor, MC Commissioner, MOH and other officers, when the MC began the discussion over handing over of the plant to them, the company’s officials said that ‘they cannot say anything as of now’. The sole garbage processing plant of the city is being run in Dadumajra by the company.

 Speaking to Chandigarh Newsline, MC Commissioner KK Yadav said, “They have backed out. There were two representatives from the Jaypee Group, their Director and the plant manager. They said, they do not know anything of this sort and cannot say anything about it. We too were surprised because before the NGT Monitoring Committee, they said that they were ready to hand over the plant to us.”

 The Commissioner added, “We have now asked them to speak to their Chairman Manoj Gaur and inform us by February 7, but they furnished a completely opposite statement in front of the NGT.”

 Sources said that the plant authorities again demanded that the corporation should pay tipping charges for the waste and then they will upgrade their plant. However, the corporation refused, saying that they had said to hand over the plant. The case will be heard before the NGT on February 12.

 Chandigarh Newsline tried to contact the Plant manager NK Vohra several times, however, he did not respond.

 Allegedly, a few days back, the plant authorities had said that they will hand over the plant to the MC, which had brought relief to the civic body as they have been struggling to end their operations with the Jaypee Group. The corporation had also decided to appoint a mediator to negatiate the salvage value earlier, however, there has been a turn of events.

 Similar ordeal

 In 2017, the general house resolved to terminate the contract mutually and also signed a mutual termination agreement. The tribunal gave time up to March 2017 for the Municipal Corporation to find a replacement. However, the Jaypee Group asked for Rs 30 crore as salvage value, to which the Corporation did not agree. Moreover, the company, which the MC short listed as a replacement to set up the plant refused to pay such a hefty salvage value.

 In the lack of a solution, the company and the MC struck a compromise and the Jaypee Group agreed to continue its operations at the plant from April 1, 2017, without any tipping fee. However, the two broke up over the treatment of garbage and the MC moved NGT, which advised them to work for public interest and solve the issue amicably. The saga continued and both the parties again joined hands, with the Jaypee Group putting up a proposal to the MC officials, wherein it said, it was ready to upgrade its plant and set up a compost plant. However, yet again, only 25 per cent of waste is being processed and MC says it is not satisfied.

 An endless battle

 The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation alleged that the Jaypee group has not been processing the entire waste. MC Commissioner KK Yadav had said that Jaypee was one of the key reasons to why the city was defaulting in the Swacch Survekshan survey. He said that the company has been processing only 20 to 25 per cent of the entire waste, leaving the rest unprocessed. Chandigarh generates over 450 tonnes of waste.

 The civic body has been in a legal battle with the garbage processing company for over four years. Following a memorandum of understanding signed between the parties in 2005 and 2008, Jaypee had set up a garbage processing plant at Dadumajra. However, few years later, Jaypee began demanding a tipping or processing fee for the garbage, even as the MC contended that the agreement signed between them did not mention the payment of the tipping fee.

 Following several letters sent by the company to the MC, threatening to shut the plant, the company finally suspended operations and shut down the plant on July 11, 2016. The civic body then moved the National Green Tribunal requesting it to ask Jaypee to resume operations in public interest as the garbage was not being processed and had to be dumped at Dadumajra. The tribunal gave them relief and asked Jaypee Group to resume operations, following which the garbage processing unit was opened again on July 27.

 However, the NGT then asked the Municipal Corporation and Jaypee to amicably solve the issue. However, the MC again said that Jaypee had not been processing the waste. The MC said, the agreement made with the Jaypee Group was so “faulty” that they will not be able to easily severe ties with the company due to legal binding.

 In a first, a graphic novel has been awarded the 2020 John Newbery Medal. Author and illustrator Jerry Craft’s New Kid, which won the prestigious honour, is about the life of African-American boy Jordan Banks, who is interested in art but is forced to enroll in a private school by his parents. He is one of the few kids of colour there.

 “I’d love for New Kid to be a book that African-American kids proudly claim as their own, while other kids see it as a book that always embraces them without ever being condescending. And it’s very important for me to make them laugh.,” Craft wrote in 2019 as quoted by a report in CNET.

 Named after the 18th-century bookseller John Newbery, The Newbery Medal is awarded to the author who has contributed most significantly to American literature for children. It is conferred annually by the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association. It was first awarded in 1922. Last year, Merci Suárez Changes Gears by Meg Medina had received the honour.

 New Kid also won the Coretta Scott King Award.

 The win has greatly impressed people on social media with many egging the writer to craft a follow-up to his celebrated graphic novel.

 Graphic novels, as a genre, have rarely been considered for literary prizes. In 2018, Nick Drnaso’s Sabrina was longlisted for the Booker creating a buzz.

 Not selected for the Republic Day parade at Rajpath in New Delhi, the Model Burail Jail’s tableau was displayed at the parade ground in Sector 17 during the Republic Day celebrations here on Sunday, and also claimed the first prize in the function.

 ‘Rupantaran’ or transformation was the theme of the tableau, which also carried a sizeable replica of the Le-Corbusier designed chair. The symbols of different tools were also a part of the tableau.

 The introduction of the tableau displayed about the food supplied to the angwanwadi centres in Chandigarh. ‘Srijan’, an outlet for the sale of products of Model Burail Jail, was also described on the tableau. Meanwhile, the UT Education department got the second position and Forest department won the third prize.

 Officials said, “As the MHA had rejected the concept of tableau for its display at Rajpath, the UT Administration decided to show it at Parade Ground in Sector 17. A Kolkata-based agency was hired for making the mail tableau for a whopping Rs 20 lakh.”

 The UT administration had proposed the tableau of Model Burail Jail for the Republic Day celebrations in Delhi in September 2019 as the selectors had said that Chandigarh displays the tableau of Rock Garden and Sukhna Lake most of the times. Later, Ministry of Defense had rejected the proposed tableau in December 2019.

 IG (Prisons) Ombir Singh said, “There are so many constructive activities going on inside the jail. The Rupantaran (transformation) project, a joint initiative of the Model Burail jail and Panjab University (PU) inside the jail premises, for reforming selective inmates has also been approved by the UT Administration. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) has been signed between the two institutes.”

 UT Adviser Manoj Parida was the Chief Guest at 71th Republic Day celebrations in the Parade Ground. The overall best turn award in the parade was conferred on the Chandigarh Police, whereas, in the category of military forces and police contingent, the first prize was bagged by the Chandigarh Ladies Police (RTC) and Haryana Police-II, while the second position was bagged by Punjab Police-I and the third position was won by the Punjab Police II. In the category which included home guard, fire brigade and civil defence, the first prize was bagged by the Chandigarh Home Guard, the second position was won by the Chandigarh Fire Services, while the third prize was won by the Civil Defence.

 A state health department official said 148 persons were put under observation on Monday, taking the total figure to 436. “The number of people under observation can go up in the coming days if the return of Keralites from China continue. So far, no one has tested positive. We had sent six samples to the virology lab in Pune, but all of them tested negative. Tomorrow, we are sending a few more samples,’’ official said.

 Stating that the situation is under control at present, the official said, “We have to be realistic, especially after a positive case was confirmed in Nepal. We fear such a possibility and the department is fully prepared to meet such an eventuality,” he said.

 Health department sources said a major chunk of those who have been put under observation was directly picked up from airports after they returned from China. “They are students and business travellers. A section of them have reported at hospitals days after landing in Kerala following the alert issued by the health department.’’

 “Lakhs of people gather there [Shaheen Bagh],” Verma told ANI. “People of Delhi will have to think and take a decision. They will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, kill them. Today there is time. Tomorrow Modi ji won’t come to save you, Amit Shah won’t come to save you. The people of Delhi are safe only till Modi ji is the prime minister of India.”

 “Arvind Kejriwal says I am with Shaheen Bagh, the Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia says I am with Shaheen Bagh,” Verma added. “The people of Delhi know the fire that once broke out in Kashmir, where the sisters and daughters of Kashmiri Pandits were raped...The same fire broke out in Uttar Pradesh, in Hyderabad, in Kerala, now the same fire has broken out in a corner of Delhi.”

 This came a day after Union minister Anurag Thakur had encouraged the audience at a rally to shout an incendiary slogan. Thakur, the minister of state for finance, shouted “desh ke gaddaron ko”, and the crowd responded with “goli maaro saalon ko [shoot the traitors to the country]”.

 On Monday, Verma said Shaheen Bagh protests will be cleared in an hour if the BJP won the Delhi Assembly elections, News18 reported. “If the BJP comes to power in Delhi on February 11, we will clear Shaheen Bagh of all protest and protesters within one hour. Not a single person will be visible,” he said, while addressing a crowd at a community centre in Ranhola village, West Delhi.

 The BJP leader added that within one month all the existing mosques built on government land will be demolished.

 Hundreds of women, along with children, have been peacefully protesting at Shaheen Bagh for almost a month and a half. The police’s attempts to persuade them to leave have failed.

1729,0,Gujarati,pqr,"Kolkata: The West Bengal Assembly on Monday passed a resolution demanding to scrap of contentious new citizenship law.

 The resolution, moved by State Parliamentary Affairs Minister Partha Chatterjee in a special session, was backed by members of the Congress and Left Front while the BJP opposed it.

 The Left and the Congress members, however, expressed their dismay at the state government not allowing them to move a resolution against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act earlier this month and wanted to move some amendments.

 However, they did not press ahead with their amendments following appeals from Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Chatterjee.

 Banerjee, in her speech, described the resolution as one upholding humanity, which the law flouts.

 “This is no Hindu-Muslim issue. It is a matter of humanity. This law is a shame for humanity,” she said.

 Banerjee said the CAA, National Population Register (NPR) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) are inter-connected.

 “These are the same thing. So this is not the time for us to quarrel. We all have to fight against dictatorship,” she said, in an appeal to the Congress-LF members.

 The resolution was passed under rule 169 of the rules of business of the House.

 It was adopted without voting, making West Bengal the fourth state in the country to pass such a resolution in its legislature.

 The CPI-M-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) government in Kerala and Congress-ruled Punjab and Rajasthan have already passed similar resolutions in the respective Assemblies demanding to scrap of the CAA.

 Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao has also announced that the state Assembly will pass a resolution against the Act.

 Leader of the Opposition Abdul Mannan, of the Congress, and the Left Front legislature party leader Sujon Chakraborty, of the CPI-M, were present in the House.

 BJP legislator Swadhin Sarkar opposed the resolution.

 On January 20, Chief Minister Banerjee announced that a resolution against the Citizenship Amendment Act will be passed in the state Assembly. (IANS)

 Ajay Devgn is all set to play the role of legendary football coach Syed Abdul Rahim, who coached India to victory at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, in Amit Sharmas Maidaan. Today, the actor took to his Twitter page to drop the teaser poster of this sports film.

 He captioned the poster as, #MaidaanTeaser - Get ready for Maidaan! 27th November 2020 ⚽.

 Speaking about Maidaan, director Amit Sharma earlier told PTI, It is a story of a person who has done a lot. I am not calling it a biopic, I am calling it the golden era of Indian football. The film is about that. So the challenge is how to make this in the best way.

 He further added, The scale is bigger, football is there, sports is there, but it wont be going in the cliche zone. We are trying to give it a fresh perspective. Thats the challenge.

 Earlier, Ajay Devgn, who is playing the role of a football coach in the film, said that he is flattered and honoured to work with the Badhaai Ho director.

 Initially, South actress Keerthy Suresh was supposed to make her Bollywood debut with this Ajay Devgn starrer. However, the actress opted out of the film as the makers felt she looked too young for her part in the movie. Priyamani replaced her in the film.

 An official statement from the makers read, Keerthy shot for the film for a day. After the shoot, the makers and Keerthy both felt that she looked too young as she had lost a lot of weight since being signed for the film to authentically portray the role of a mother as has been written in the script.

 Produced by Zee Studios, Boney Kapoor, Akash Chawla and Arunava Joy Sengupta, Maidaan is slated to hit the theatrical screens on November 27, 2020.

 Mr Martin Schwenk, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer at Mercedes-Benz India said, At Auto Expo 2020, beside launching the AMG GT 4 Door Coupe, unveiling the A-Class Limousine and the New GLA SUV, we also will be launching something unique and never seen before in India.

 Inspired by the success of the V-Class Luxury MPV in India, we will be launching the V-Class Marco Polo Camper. Nothing reflects restlessness and a spirit of adventure better than an exciting road-trip and camping, he added.

 Mercedes-Benz says the V-Class Marco Polo embodies these traits, and blends outdoor ruggedness with the companys world-renowned luxury and technology. Merc expects that the V-Class Marco Polo camper to generate a lot of interest among their existing customers, who already have shown a massive interest to the V-Class luxury MPV models.

 There is no concrete information about features and specification at the moment. The Mercedes-Benz V-Class Marco Polo is currently available in international markets and has been named after the explorer Marco Polo.

 The Marco Polo available in foreign markets feature front seats that swivel, and rear seats that fold flat to make for a bed. The vehicle also features a pop-up roof that reveals an ‘upstairs sleeping space.

 The V-Class Marco Polo features built in wardrobes, drawers, a stove, a sink with fresh and waste water tanks, and a fridge among a host of other elements that make it a mobile home.

 At the heart of the V-Class Marco Polo is a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine that produces 234bhp of power and 500Nm of torque, and comes mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission.

 Safety features on the Mercedes-Benz V-Class Marco Polo include brake assist, front and side impact beams, a crash sensor, a centrally mounted fuel tank, attention assist, and hill assist among others.

 Thoughts About The Mercedes-Benz V-Class Marco Polo Launching In India

 Camper-style travel is not an Indian thing. Most folk only use a vehicle to get from place A to B, and live out of hotel or resorts, not their vehicles. While the concept is great, we think India is better off with seven, eight, and nine seater vehicles rather than campers.

 India is engaged in conversations with its neighbours except one country in order to develop a joint approach for regional peace and security.

 True pathway to regional peace and security lies in understanding each others sensitivities and following basic principles of non-interference in each others internal affairs, he said.

 Singh asserted the South Asia region must unite in their efforts to defeat terrorism. Mumbai, Pathankot, Uri, and Pulwama attacks are grim reminders of state-sponsored terrorism by a neighbouring country.

1745,0,Telugu,pqr,"A gay couple has moved the Kerala High Court, seeking to strike down certain provisions under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, which do not permit to get their marriage registered.

 Considering the writ petition by the petitioners on Monday, the court has sought the views of Central and state governments on the matter.

 The petitioners are Kochi natives, Nikesh Usha Pushkaran and Sonu MS, a business man and an IT professional. They met in May 2018 and fell in love. After being in a relationship for two months, they decided to exchange vows and get married.

 In September, they took the plunge, and tied the knot. In a small and private ceremony, they got married in the same way heterosexual couples do in India. They then tried to get the marriage solemnised.

 This is where they met the first roadblock.

 According to reports, religious authorities declined to solemnise the wedding. In India, when you cannot have a marriage recognised under personal, religious laws, you look to the Special Marriage Act.

 So thats what the couple did.

 They decided to get their marriage registered under the Special Marriage Act, 1954.

 Unfortunately, here they hit roadblock two - The Special Marriage Act does not recognise homosexual marriages.

 In their plea, the couple stated that they were aggrieved by the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 whereby the law only permits a heterosexual couple to get married and a homosexual couple like them is denied equal access to the institution of marriage.

 “The institution of marriage affords certain rights and privileges to the persons in matrimony in the society and due to the aforesaid exclusion, the homosexual couples like the petitioners are denied an opportunity to enjoy similar rights and privileges. Being married carries along with it the right to maintenance, right of inheritance, a right to own joint bank accounts, lockers; nominate each other as a nominee in insurance, pension, gratuity papers etc. All these are unavailable to the Petitioners due to their exclusion from the institution of marriage, making the said exclusion more discriminatory,” the petition reads.

 They stated that the impugned provisions of the Act violate their fundamental rights and are thus illegal and unconstitutional to that extent.

 “The petitioners’ right to expression of love in the form that they aspire to conduct will be meaningless if their marital union is not recognised by law. Expression of love, growth of one’s personality within a relationship and development of an identity of a union will be incomplete if the law refuses to recognize same-sex marriages and thereby it affects the Article 19(1) rights of the petitioners guaranteed by Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India,” the petition adds.

 Seeking declarations in this connection and to obtain the relief for getting married under the Act, the writ petition was being moved jointly by the petitioners, who submitted that they have suffered public humiliation after they disclosed their love for each other.

 But, greater is the insult and indignity the petitioners have suffered at the hands of law, which refuses to recognise their union, causing immense pain and agony to them, they said in the petition.

 The couple has also stated that any law that fails to protect a person’s self-determination of sexual identity and treat that identity with dignity disrespects individual choice and thus is “irrational, arbitrary, violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.

 Noting that the impugned provisions restrict the process of application, solemnisation and registration of marriages to heterosexual couples alone and exclude homosexual couples from its ambit, the petitioners said it must be held unconstitutional and thus be struck or read down to that extent of illegality.

 Kerala has been winning in the LGBTQI+ field for a while now. The state has multiple instances of both personal successes of queer and trans people, as well as of state policies and programs that have been made to lead to the development of these communities.

 For example, the Kochi Metro took steps to hire a large number of transgender people as a part of their development initiative. Kochi also saw the opening of the first all-transgender school in 2016.

 Kannur district has allocated a portion of its budget solely towards training trans people and giving them employment opportunities. Kerala also has reservations for trans students in colleges. The state government has a policy which has made sex-change surgeries in government hospitals free.

 As you can see though, the policies in place for same sex couples - with respect to marriage, adoption, tax paying, and home ownership - are all gaps that still need to be filled. Hopefully, with this petition before the High Court, the state can take the first steps towards filing these gaps.

Well, to most it seems quite obvious; Yes, we will not, but many people who are new to the world of digital payment every now and then end up doing such basic mistakes. And this time, it was a Bengaluru techie.

 Arjun Jagannathan, a 40 years old software engineer, has defrauded for Rs 1.27 lakh when he was trying to buy liquor online for a party at home. Arjun is a resident of Yelenahalli. On the 19th of January, he was at his mother’s house for a get-together party. He wanted to buy liquor online. He started searching online for tavern delivering liquor home, and he came across one near Kothanur Dinne (a locality in Bengaluru).

 Arjun called the tavern and spoke to a man who introduced himself as a staffer at the tavern. The staffer took the order and bill came up to Rs 1,500. The man told Arjun to pay online as they do not accept cash-on-delivery for home delivery. Arjun agreed to pay online. The man asked him to share his credit card details and later asked to share the OTP to complete payment. Arjun did the same. He ended up getting Rs 1,500 debited from his account.

 But the man said there was some technical error, please share the fresh OTP gain. And this time he got a message saying Rs 6,000 was debited from his account. Well, repeating the same pattern, he convinced Arjun again and again to share the series of OTPs, and in the end, Arjun had lost Rs 78,742.

 The staffer apologized and said he will return the money and asked him to scan a Paytm QR code which he sent by WhatsApp. And Arjun once again lost Rs 49,001 from his UPI-linked savings account. Well, it may seem unreal, but it happened.

 When Arjun Jagannathan realized that he was scammed, he immediately blocked his account and ask banking officials to reverse the payments, but they cannot do it to the UPI and credit card transactions.

 Arjun Jagannathan has filed a case under the Information Technology Act, and police are investigating into the matter.

1751,0,Gujarati,abc,"The finance ministry has invited appliations to appoint the next chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India to succeed Ajay Tyagi, whose three-year term comes to an end in February.

 Tyagi, a 1984 batch IAS officer of Himachal Pradesh cadre, was appointed as SEBI chairman on Mar. 1, 2017, for the period of three years. It was widely expected that Tyagi would get at least two years extension given his stellar performance on the job.

 The public notice dated Jan. 24 inviting application from eligible candidates indicates that the government in not inclined to do so.

 Applications of eligible candidates in prescribed proforma along with attested copies of annual confidential report for the last five years, vigilance clearance and no penalty and integrity certificate in case of serving government employees should reach on or before Feb. 10, according to the public notice issued by finance ministrys economic affairs department.

 The government had given extension to UK Sinha for three years, making him the second longest-serving SEBI chairman.

 In the case of Tyagi, the government issued the appointment notification twice. According to the first notification issued on Feb. 10, 2017, Tyagi, the then additional secretary (investment) in the department of economic affairs, was appointed the SEBI chairman for a period not exceeding five years or till the age of 65 years or until further order, whichever is earlier. Subsequently, another notification curtailed his appointment to an initial period of three years.

 Since age is on his side, Tyagi can apply for the job again. However, this will be considered fresh appointment and not an extension.

 According to the procedure for the appointment of regulators, the candidates will be shortlisted by the financial sector regulatory appointments search committee headed by the cabinet secretary.

 The shortlisted candidates are interviewed by the panel comprising of the economic affairs aecretary and three external members with domain knowledge. Based on that interaction, FSRASC recommends name to the appointments committee of the cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for approval.

 Talking about the shoot of the Akshay Kumar film and how his character has been developed, the report quoted him as saying, “We shot for four days in Ooty. The film is complete, save for a day or two of patchwork. Both Akshay sir and my characters have our own agendas. He supported me a lot during the shoot. My character is not a typical baddie, he has his own ideology, does things for his people and is very real with an emotional undercurrent.”

 “It is a big deal to play the antagonist in a Rohit Shetty film. Everything on the set was so larger-than-life,” he added.

 He will be introduced in the film with an action scene, the report added. Speaking about the action sequences, which have been choreographed by Sunil Rodrigues, he said that were shot realistically with “jumps between buildings, gun fights, bomb blasts, firing.” The report added that Rohit decided on Abhimanyu after watching his action sequences in 2017’s Tamil film, Theeran Adhigaaram Ondru.

 For the climax scene, which was shot over 20 days, Rohit brought together Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh to reprise their respective screen cop avatars to join Akshay’s fight against terrorism. “It was surreal to be shooting with them, only Rohit could have brought them together. It’s not easy tackling three stars at one time.”

 It will be rolled out in government hospitals in Karnataka from April 1

 With this, the hospitals can upload medical records and use them with consent when needed

 Mental health, which has been neglected in mainstream media and conversations for a long time in India, is slowly gaining attention and efforts are being taken across sectors.

 One such recent initiative is the software developed jointly by The National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro-Sciences (Nimhans) and IIIT-B to strengthen the treatment of patients suffering from mental illness. The software, developed as part of the Karnataka Mental Health Management System, will help health authorities maintain the mental health history of millions of patients, and develop treatments for specific cohorts wherever possible.

 Funded by the Karnataka government, the software will be rolled out in government hospitals from April 1, after a month-long pilot in March. Doctors have already been trained to use the software.

 Hospitals will upload the medical records to the platform, and from there,  government or private doctors can view these records with the consent of the patient. “We have ensured total protection of privacy and rights of the patient in compliance with the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017,” Dr BN Gangadhar, director of Nimhans, was quoted as saying by ET.

 “We have ensured total protection of privacy and rights of the patient in compliance with the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017,” said Gangadhar added. District government hospitals across Karnataka are also running a flagship mental health programme to address the issue of mental health. IIIT-B has also planned an INR 200 Cr proposal to transform public health, which includes the mental health space, with the help of technology.

 According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), for every 100K people, 2400 years cumulatively are spent managing mental disability or trauma. In addition to the stigma attached to seeking professional help, there is also a shortage of mental wellness professionals in India, estimated to be around 0.07 clinical professionals per 100K people (as of 2017).

 However, efforts are being taken by various mental health startups such as Cure.fit vertical Mind.fit, YourDOST, YourHour, Headspace, InnerHour and more, to reduce the gap. These startups provide easy access to professional help with the use of technology.

 For instance, pi Ventures-backed Wysa reinvents self-help with an artificial intelligence-backed conversational bot that uses scripted responses to guide users through disturbing thoughts and stressful situations. Basically, Wysa is a virtual coach that combines empathetic listening with evidence-based therapeutic techniques like CBT, meditation and motivational interviewing. Another Bengaluru-based fitness startup Cure.Fit’s mental wellness vertical Mind.Fit also offers online and offline yoga, meditation and therapy services.

 Wysa claims to have over 1.3 Mn users from more than 30 countries, with a majority of them being free users. The app is said to have conducted over 19 Mn conversations and has a 50% month on month customer repeat rate. Further, the company claims to have facilitated over a million breakthroughs, which is an impact equivalent to about 3 Mn hours of in-person therapy.

1758,0,Telugu,abc,"Kolkata Metro Rail Corp. expects to complete its East-West project, which runs partly under the city’s iconic Hooghly river, by March 2022 after a delay of several years doubled costs.

 The authority is awaiting a final instalment of 200 million rupees ($2.8 million) over the next two years from the Indian Railway Board, said Manas Sarkar, managing director at KMRC. A soft loan of 41.6 billion rupees from Japan International Cooperation Agency helps fund 48.5% of the project.

 India’s oldest metro, which started in 1984 with a North-South service, was due to expand by 2014 but faced problems including squatters on the planned route. These issues have contributed to the total project cost rising to about 86 billion rupees for some 17 kilometers from 49 billion rupees for 14 km.

 “About 40% of total transport demand will be tackled by these two metro services,” Sarkar said in an interview at his office in Kolkata. “It will be a relief for environmental pollution and the city should be much more decongested.”

 The new line is expected to carry about 900,000 people daily, -- roughly 20% of the city’s population -- and will take less than a minute to cross a 520-meter underwater tunnel. Depending on the time of day, it takes some 20 minutes to use the ferry and anywhere upward of an hour to cross the Howrah bridge.

 KMRC will repay the JICA loan over 30 years after an initial six-year moratorium. The interest rate is between 1.2% to 1.6%. The East-West metro project is 74% owned by India’s Railway Ministry and 26% by the nation’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.

 “We don’t anticipate any further cost escalation now,” Sarkar said.

 The controversial remarks by the BJP’s West Delhi MP comes amid a renewed effort by top BJP leaders to keep the narrative ahead of the February 8 elections centered on the protests in Shaheen Bagh against the amended citizenship law. The protesters have demanded that the government scrap the law that grants citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Buddhists and Christians fleeing religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh if they entered India on or before December 31, 2014.

 Verma has also claimed that the government would clear out the Shaheen Bagh protest site as soon it forms the government in the national capital. He did not explain why the election outcome matters. Delhi Police, which is responsible for law and order as well as traffic in the city, already reports to the Home Ministry at the Centre where the BJP is in power.

 According to ANI, Verma told an election meeting at Vikaspuri assembly segment on Monday that he would remove all mosques built on government land in his Lok Sabha constituency if the BJP wins the state election.

1760,0,Gujarati,xyz,"Monday’s episode of Bigg Boss 13 begins with Rashami hilariously telling Sidharth and Mahira that she always gets caught whenever she steals something. Sidharth also jokingly says that she should steal bigger things so that everyone knows. Sidharth and Rashami have a conversation with each other wherein she says she is thinking about how he is noticing her and taking care of her suddenly. Rashami also asks him whether he is doing everything for the sake of the game to which he replies in the negative.

 Later on, Asim talks to Rashami and Vishal about his mood swings and how Sidharth prompts his anger. Vishal asks Asim to maintain distance from Paras to which the latter agrees. Next morning the housemates wake up and dance to another song. Shehnaaz mimics the crows as Rashami looks on. Sidharth asks Rashami the reason behind not having tea to which she gives a sarcastic answer. Thereafter, both of them get involved in a fun banter.

 Asim tries to clear things with Sidharth and also apologizes to him for the previous fights. Asim says that this thing is bothering him and Sidharth. Meanwhile, Shehnaaz tells Sidharth that she is hurt because of him. On being asked the reason, she says that he stays with those people whom she does not like. Shehnaaz also says how Sidharth made others stop her during one of the tasks. Sidharth says that Shehnaaz was not in his team because of which he did the same. Shehnaaz says that she respects him despite whatever happened. Sidharth finally gets irked and walks away. He confronts Asim for singing a song for him and Shehnaaz. Asim, however, clarifies that he did not sing the song for him.

 Later on, Sidharth schools Shehnaaz for interacting with those people who are against him. Shehnaaz tells him that he also talks to Rashami to which he says that he has started talking to her only recently. She says that she does not want to be a member of the team which he has made. She tells him again that she always supports him despite being hurt all the time. Shehnaaz says that she does not want to get hurt because of which she maintains distance from him. Later on, Asim asks Shehnaaz about her game plan. She asks him whether he knows the same to which he says that he knows the variations. Sidharth and Shehnaaz get involved in a hilarious yet sarcastic conversation after some time.

 Both of them also try to clear things out with each other. Bigg Boss informs the housemates that the punishment term of Paras and Vishal for cancelling tasks is finally over. However, they are also informed about certain rules and regulations which have been broken by a few housemates. Thereafter, they are shown a clipping of Vishal, Asim and Rashami wherein they are seen discussing nominations and doing calculations about ousting Paras, Arti and others during tasks.

 Asim asks what wrong has he done to which Shehnaaz says that they had discussed about nominations. Thereafter, Vishal and Paras get involved in an argument about the same. Paras says that he can get a lot of footage without even talking to Asim and Vishal. Shehnaaz says in between that Paras is the one who eavesdrops a lot inside the house. Arti says that she isn’t bothered about all these things as she knows that Asim is playing a game. Vishal clarifies in front of Mahira that he asked Asim to stay away from Paras as the latter instigates him for a fight. This leads to another major fight between Paras and Asim. Bigg Boss informs them that they will not be punished for this but it definitely serves as the last warning for them.

 Vishal goes to clear things out with Paras and Mahira. However, Paras refuses to talk to him. Mahira advises Paras that he needs to come back and entertain as he did before. Shehnaaz tells Vishal that Paras is playing a game and that they should not react on the same. Meanwhile, Mahira, Paras and Rashami get involved in an argument regarding the stolen tea leaves. Paras also confronts Rashami about her duties which irks her.

 On the other hand, Shehnaaz tries to talk to Sidharth but he says that he will talk to her the other day. However, he does talk to her post which Shehnaaz asks him whether he missed talking to her. The two of them hug each other thereafter. Rashami shows Vishal the new facilities that have arrived inside the elite club. All the other housemates also come and have a look at the same. Next, it’s time for the nominations task wherein the housemates will have to keep track of time inside the nomination dome. The ones who are not able to keep track of the time will end up getting nominated.

 The task begins with Vishal entering the dome. Arti tries to distract him as others look on. On the other hand, Shehnaaz admits in front of Sidharth that she is possessive about him and that she cannot stay without talking to him. Sidharth tells Shehnaaz that he has never come in between her fights with Paras. Shehnaaz too says that she does not have any issue with Sidharth talking to Rashami. Next, Mahira enters the nomination dome followed by Paras, Shehnaaz, Rashami and then Asim.

 Mahira tries to distract Asim by putting colour on his hair. Thereafter, Arti and Sidharth also enter the dome and do their rounds. Arti informs everyone about Mahira and Paras’ game during the task which they applaud. Arti and Vishal discuss whether Sidharth is staying for long inside the dome for the sake of saving Shehnaaz. Bigg Boss informs the housemates about the amount of time they took during the task. Arti, Sidharth, Shehnaaz and Vishal end up getting nominated. Later on, Sidharth and Shehnaaz try to clear things out.

 “The decision was made out of respect for the Lakers organisation, which is deeply grieving the tragic loss of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other people in a helicopter crash on Sunday,” the National Basketball Association said in a statement, reports Efe news.

 The Lakers confirmed the postponement, adding in a statement that “this is a very difficult time for all of us. We continue to support the Bryant family and will share more information as it is available.”

 The NBA added that the game, the first to be suspended after the news of the crash, will be played at a later date not yet specified.

 Bryant had played his whole career with the Lakers, becoming a five-time NBA champion and double Olympic gold medalist before he retired in 2016. His daughter Gianna was also a talented player.

 Tributes have been pouring in from around the world, with past and present US leaders, NBA greats, and the public paying their respects and expressing shock at the accident.

 Meanwhile, the US federal and local investigators on Monday began probing the cause of the crash. Thick fog at the time of the accident outside downtown Los Angeles is the main focus of the investigation, according to authorities, who said their final conclusions will be released in the coming months.

 The pilot had been given special authorisation to fly in foggy conditions that had grounded Los Angeles Police Department helicopters.

 Along with 41-year-old Bryant and one of his daughters, 13-year-old Gianna, also perished in the crash were a baseball coach at Orange Coast College, John Altobelli; his wife, Keri Altobelli; their daughter, Alyssa Altobelli, who was on Gianna’s basketball team; a female basketball coach, Christina Mauser; another of Gianna’s teammates, Payton Chester; Payton’s mother, Sarah Chester; and the pilot, Ara Zobayan.

1770,0,Telugu,pqr,"Hamilton: Batting coach Vikram Rathour on Tuesday called the new generation of Indian cricketers incredible and said the team management has already identified the core of players for the T20 World Cup in October-November.

 File image of Vikram Rathour. AP

 Rathour was speaking ahead of the third T20I between India and New Zealand at Seddon Park on Wednesday, with the Men in Blue leading the five-match series 2-0.

 Adjustments will keep going on till the last minute. But as far as I am concerned and the team management is concerned, we have the core. We know what our team is going to be. Unless there is a case of injury or really bad loss in form, I dont see many changes happening, said Rathour.

 With one eye on T20 World Cup in Australia, India have been on experimentation mode since the start of the home season in September last year, giving opportunities to host of youngsters, including Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Deepak Chahar, and Shivam Dube.

 The T20 team has been doing really well in New Zealand and the young guns have contributed significantly to its success, leaving the batting coach hugely impressed.

 This new generation of cricketers is incredible. I find it amazing actually that they turn up and they are at their best straightaway across different formats, different grounds, and different countries actually. The amount of time they took to get settled (in New Zealand) was outstanding, he said.

 India won the twin matches in Auckland thanks to brilliant outings from KL Rahul and Iyer. The batting coach expressed satisfaction that the younger batsmen are stepping forward for the teams cause.

 The more opportunities that these guys get, they are showing that they are capable. They are showing that they are match-winners on their day. That will help the team, of course, but it will also help their confidence.

 Having seen KL (Rahul) and Shreyas as young cricketers coming through, in my mind, I have absolutely no doubt that they are match-winners. They are getting their opportunities now and they are showing the world what they are capable of, that is great to see, he said.

 Rathour feels Iyers mindset makes him a better player.

 Apart from having those (batting) skills, I think the mindset is amazing. He (Iyer) believes he is a big player, and he is, without any doubt. He genuinely believes that he is a match-winner and he is here to stay. And that mindset, I think, helps him, that is the biggest advantage he has, he said.

 When asked about the ability of the current generation to learn from the IPL whilst maintaining percentage shots as big hits, Rathour said, Big power-hitters and all, that time was there initially, people used to think T20 is more to do with power-hitting but its not the case anymore. Proper cricketing shots, you still get value for shots.

 Talking about the adaptation needed from one format to another, the coach said: Players play so much cricket these days, all three formats consistently, day-in, day-out, they are making these adjustments on their own. The game of cricket has changed with time. Even in Test cricket, big shots are common. I dont think it is that big a difference.

 It is more of a mindset thing and about game plan. As a coach, I dont think we really need to tell them anything. They are doing it on their own. They are stronger, fitter than from our generation. You can see that they are hitting big sixes and without any effort, that way the game has changed.

 The next three games at Hamilton, Wellington and Mt Maunganui will be played at regular-sized grounds unlike Eden Park in Auckland. Rathour hinted that there wont be many alterations to the teams strategy, apart from the bowlers firming up new plans as per conditions on offer.

 You look at the conditions and go. It (Seddon Park) is a bigger ground, it is a regular ground, but we are still looking to play normal cricket, good cricket. I dont think it alters anything. Maybe for the bowlers with their lengths, but with the batters, it doesnt make any difference.

 On bigger grounds (like in Australia), running between wickets will cover the game plan. A good game plan is about players who look at the situation, conditions and accordingly bat. If we play on bigger grounds, I am sure this team is capable of running twos and threes and adjust their game accordingly, he said.

 Since his appointment as batting coach of the senior team, a part of Rathours brief has been to bring up the younger batsmen in the side. In that aspect, he expressed satisfaction in terms of how the younger generation is coming through via A tours.

 They help a lot. In case of any injuries, if you are looking for any replacements, we know players are here, just a city away. They can immediately come in and they are already acclimatised to the conditions. I think thats a great idea and thats working really well for our team.

 The foreign pitches are getting more even and even. There is not that vast a difference now like it used to be earlier. And the amount of cricket these guys are playing, as a coach you cant do anything about not having practice sessions but they are adjusting beautifully.

 Nobody is cribbing, no one is complaining. You dont see anyone talking about grass on the wicket, moisture, etc, he added.

1771,0,English,abc,"Kobe Bryant’s 13-year-old daughter Gianna, who died alongside her father in the helicopter crash that claimed the life of the NBA legend, had shown signs that she could further her father’s glittering basketball legacy.

 Her proud father once said the second-born of the Los Angeles Lakers star’s four daughters with wife Vanessa was “something else” on the basketball court.

 Bryant’s eldest daughter, 17-year-old Natalia, prefers volleyball, Bianka is only three and Capri was only born last year.

 So the 41-year-old NBA great’s basketball hopes were invested in Gianna. “It’s a trip to see her move and the expressions she makes. It’s a trip how genetics work,” Bryant told US chat show host Jimmy Kimmel in 2018.

 “The best thing that happens is when we go out and fans would come up to me and she’ll be standing next to me... and they’ll be like, ‘You’ve gotta have a boy, you and V, gotta have a boy. You gotta have somebody to carry on your tradition, the legacy. She (Gianna) is like, ‘I got this’. I’m like, ‘that’s right’,” he went on. “Yes, you do, you got this.”

 Gianna’s passion for basketball meant she was often pictured sitting alongside her father at games, watching his beloved Lakers at the Staples Center or the WNBA team Los Angeles Sparks.

 She often worked out with her father in the gymnasium of the family’s villa in Newport Beach and he took pride in coaching her high school team when his schedule permitted.

 Gianna was on the helicopter that crashed because she was travelling to a tournament in the Los Angeles suburbs to play for her team, called the Mamba Team, after one of her father’s nicknames.

 One of her teammates was also on board the helicopter and was also among the dead.

 Gianna’s future had already been mapped out – her heart was set on going to Connecticut, the most prestigious women’s basketball program in the US.

 And of course, she had introductions that other young girls players could only dream of – her father’s former agent Rob Pelinka introduced her to basketball stars and coaches.

 Derek Fisher, a Lakers teammate of her father and now coach of the WNBA Sparks, had noticed that Kobe’s steely will to win had rubbed off on Gianna. “They have the similar demeanor and personality,” Fisher said.

 All my adult life, I have been asked this question. It inevitably makes me feel apologetic or guilty, because I know the answer should be a resounding musical yes. It should be an answer that contains all the amazing knowledge that was carefully handed to me like pearls and rubies – the secret two-note taan, the rare compositions; that voice training that can send notes soaring high above the skyline.

 My musical journey started when a mother extricated a reluctant ten year old from her comfort zone and sent her to the reclusive and remarkable Dhondutai. She was the only student of the formidable Kesarbai, whose voice and manners could merge robust masculine with seductive feminine energies to create music that has rarely been heard before or after. Dhondutai was not that. But she was an extraordinarily gentle and patient teacher who tolerated the fidgety brat that sat in front of her three days a week for only one reason: she saw in me the qualities that she felt, if nurtured, would carry forth the Jaipur gharana legacy.

 “To be a true musician, you have to be amir or fakir,” she often said. Because, in either case, you have freedom. Through her, I started finding musical metaphors in everything around – the whirring drone of the fan; the recurrent cry of a street vendor; in festivals, in colour, in the scent of sandalwood that snaked out of her dollshouse of gods and goddesses.

 Even when she made tea, she would combine two different strains in a very particular ratio, and compare them to the compound combination ragas, a specialty of the Jaipur gharana. “Like the tea, they should come together so seamlessly, that you should not be able to tell when one raga finishes and the other starts…” she said.

 And so, I grew up at the feet of my third grandmother in this alternate plane where music became breath. I learned Raga Bhoop for more than two years and only when the foundation was unshakable, I was guided further down the road – to the light and lilting Tilak Kamod, the sombre morning notes of Lalit, a plaintive composition in Jaijaiwanti, a majestic Basanti Kedar, and so many more. Some I stayed with; some were only to be able to accompany my teacher in a concert, where I learned how to fill the notes in between and to sustain holding a tanpura without allowing my foot to fall asleep. Indian music is about so much more than music. It is about patience and humility and an understanding that there can be something so immense that one life is scarcely enough.

 I went away to college in America. Although I had a degree from Princeton, I came back to Borivli, to Dhondutai. Like a migratory crane that follows its own bird wisdom. I wanted to become a professional singer. I spent a year in serious training, ignoring the muffled sniggers of friends and my baffled but indulgent parents. I got up early in the morning to train my voice, building each note as gradually as the rising sun. I started paying close attention to the nuances that come when a singer matures, modulating voice and tone, enabling expression and pause.

 But I started faltering. I could not keep up the rigour that this art form requires of its practitioners. One night of partying would reflect in my voice. My friends had jobs and boyfriends. I started realising that I did not have the guts to pursue a seemingly pointless passion in a world where success is measured in terms of how much money you make and how well you are known. I was too scared to carry on. So, I continued to go visit my beloved teacher, but I fell into my second love – writing. I stopped singing.

 A few years ago, I was at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in South Bombay to visit my old friend Suvarnalata Rao. Gleaming musical instruments lined the wall like ancestral portraits. She asked me that dreaded question:

 Do you still sing?

 I replied, “Not really… well, yes, some times, but only for myself.”

 “Why do you say it like that? Do you think singing for oneself is any lesser than singing for an audience? In fact, if you think about it, it gives you much more freedom!”

 I stared at her in wonder. Suddenly, something started lifting, a weight that prevented me from engaging with a space that had once been like breathing. I realised that we have come to define everything in a performative sense, needing external validation, almost becoming a selfie version of ourselves –  the opposite of the inner world you enter when you start a Bhairavi or make that quiet cup of tea.

 I now sing. Not often. Not very well. Not to prove anything, or carry on any legacy. But with joy. Like bird song. Like the devotee who hums prayers alone in a temple. Like breath.

 This first appeared in ON Stage, the official monthly magazine of the National Centre for the Performing Arts, Mumbai.

 Sunday’s 3-1/2 hour live show from Los Angeles saw teen sensation Billie Eilish sweep all four top awards - album, song record of the year and best new artist, becoming the first woman to do so. Her brother Finneas, also her collaborator was declared the producer of the year and best engineered album, non-classical. Tyler, the Creator, Lizzo, Vampire Weekend and Lil Nas X also took home other awards.

 Performers on the live telecast also paid tribute to basketball star Kobe Bryant, who was killed in a helicopter crash hours before the Grammy show took place in the venue that is home to his former team, the Los Angeles Lakers.

 The least-watched Grammys was in 2006, when 17 million Americans tuned in. Sunday’s data, compiled by Nielsen, does not include those who watched in bars or public places.

 Despite the drop, CBS noted that the Grammys had the largest audience, and social media engagement, for a prime time entertainment show so far this year, beating the 18.3 million who watched the Golden Globes on 5 January.

1774,0,Tamil ,xyz,"NP NEWS 24 : Karachi : A Hindu girl was abducted by attackers from a wedding mandap under the supervision of local police in Matiyari district, about 215 km from Karachi province in Pakistan. According to the report, Bharti Bai (24) was then forced to confess Islam and marry a Muslim man.

 As told by locals, Bharti was to be married to a Hindu man in Hala town, but some attackers reached the wedding mandap and kidnapped her. Bharti’s father Kishore Das said that his daughter’s wedding ceremony was going on, when an attacker named Shahrukh Gul, along with some people, brought police personnel there and kidnapped his daughter in broad daylight.

 Later, documents of Bharti confessing to Islam and a photo of her marrying Shahrukh went viral on social media. One of the reasons that Bharti was abducted from the pavilion could also be that according to the documents Bharti had already converted to Islam on December 1, 2019. According to the certificate, after Bharti accepted Islam, sher name was changed to ‘Bushra’.

 Karachi-based Jamaat-ul-Uloom Islamia has also issued a certificate of conversion of Bharati. While Bharti’s family has demanded the return of their daughter, it is also being said that Bharti had converted to Islam a month before the incident. The incident has raised questions about Imran Khan’s government’s claim to save minorities.

 As per a new promo shared by the makers, the housemates were made to sit in the living area while Himanshi was inside the confession room. The TV is switched on and Vishal Singh and Asim are seen jumping in their seats on seeing Himanshi. Asim even says, “Mera dil bahar aa raha hain.”

 As soon as Himanshi enters the house, Asim runs to welcome her and hugs her. The duo then moves to the garden area, where Asim goes down on his knees and tells her that he has never done this for anyone before. He then tells her, “Will you marry me?”

 During Himanshis stint inside the house, she had formed a close bond with Asim, while the latter had openly expressed his feelings for the Punjabi actress. Post her eviction, Himanshi reportedly broke up with her beau Chow of nine years, with whom she was getting married to. She had been openly supporting Asim from outside the house and sharing pictures along with Asim on her social media.

 Himanshi had extended her support through tweets and also stood up for him when Asim was blasted by the shows host Salman Khan for being the reason for her break up.

 And one such example was his latest Instagram post that was both thoughtful and beautiful. In the picture he shared, the actor was lost in his own thoughts and shared a nice picture of himself, in his own words. He wrote a long caption thats an inspiration to all of us how to keep hope alive.

 Take a look right here:

 Hope is what has kept him relevant in Bollywood for two decades. When his career slumped and professional choices backfired, it was hope that put him back to the pedestal. And now, he stands tall and proud with two consecutive hits- Super 30 and War. Fans and friends have no idea what his next film would be, Krrish 4 or something else.

 However, what they do know is that even when he falls in the future, he will stand and rise like a Phoenix, all because of hope!

1779,0,English,pqr,"Lay off sugar. For a happier, healthier you. Undertake the 7-day no-sugar challenge!

 Are you tired of trying to get those extra pesky kilos off of your body? Are you extra irritable and unfocused by the end of each day? Do you experience a crazy dip in energy after a particularly sweetened meal?

 Promotion

 Culprit: Sugar.

 It’s one food group that’s best left out of our diets which you can do it in two ways;

 -Give it up completely. Ok. That seems harsh, no?

 -How about swapping plain sugar with healthy alternatives?

 On average, the daily sugar allowance for men is 9 teaspoons, 6 teaspoons for women and 3 for children. Even if we follow a standard daily diet of whole foods with no added sugar, we still ingest about 10 percent of our calories from natural sugars. However, once we’ve got the added sugar under control, the occasional chocolate or pastry won’t do any harm.

 Here’s how you can slowly wean off sugar in 7 days.

 Most of our cereals, granola bars, yogurts, breads, jams and spreads come laden with sugar. The best idea would be to slowly make the shift from processed foods to traditional home-cooked ones. Say for example, swap your cornflakes with a simple vegetable poha. Add fruits like an apple or a banana to make your meal more wholesome.

 Most of us have a tendency to load up on carb-rich foods such as rice or rotis for lunch. While they’re essential for the body’s proper functioning, always remember to add a good dose of protein in the form of vegetables, legumes, or even lean meat, if you please. That’ll keep you fuller for longer, while ensuring you don’t reach out for sugar treats later.

 Also, if you’re one to end a meal on a sweet note, go for small healthy bites of chikki or jaggery. While they have the same calorie content as processed sugar, they pack in some essential nutrients that your body could use.

 Promotion

 Having sugar in your beverages is the worst way to ingest sugar. If you can’t have black tea or coffee, adding a little milk or cream will do the trick since they’re naturally sweet. Since it’s not “added sugar,” it doesn’t overwhelm the liver the same way added sugar does. Also remember, it’s always better to savour a whole orange than reach for a glass of OJ. When you juice the oranges, it gets stripped of essential nutrients and fibres, giving you only fructose water.

 If, on a given day, you feel like having a dessert, treat yourself to one. Rewarding yourself from time to time will ensure that you’re not deprived of your favourite foods. Several factors play a role in making you crave something sweet at times; it’s best to succumb to it every once in a while. However, moderation is key.

 Skipping dinner is blasphemy. Eating a light dinner is key. However, make sure you don’t reach out for ready-to-eat packets that mostly have added sweet lurking about in them. A vegetable stew or some sauteed mushrooms, or even the super nutritious dal-chawal will ensure that you have stabilised blood sugar levels at night.

 Most importantly, enjoy your journey to a healthier, fitter you but cutting out the excess sugar that doesn’t serve you in any way at all. Seven days is all it will take you to adapt to this lifestyle change!

 Army Vice Chief Lt Gen SK Saini on Tuesday said terrorist launchpads are being reoccupied and their camps are being reactivated across the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

 The situation in Jammu and Kashmir on both LoC and the hinterland are under control. The launchpads have been reoccupied and terrorist camps are active. Saini said that ceasefire violations by the Pakistan Army have gone up last year but the Army was fully geared up to meet challenges that come across.

 In the last few weeks, there have been reports about the heightened activity of terrorists in PoK backed by the Pakistan Army. Asked about his priorities as Vice Chief, he said, Removing hollowness in terms of critical deficiencies of equipment, ammunition etc, capability development along the Northern borders.

 Hollowness in Army preparedness was first highlighted as few years ago when it was brought by the then Army Chief Gen VK Singh that the force was facing critical shortage of ammunition and weapon systems required for fighting wars.

 Saini also stressed that he would work for aligning the Army Headquarters with the newly created Department of Military Affairs under Chief of Defence Staff. He said he would work towards bringing in more jointness into the working of the Army with the newly created structures.

 Ajay Devgn is all set to play the role of legendary football coach Syed Abdul Rahim, who coached India to victory at the Asian Games in 1951 and 1962, in Amit Sharmas Maidaan. Today, the actor took to his Twitter page to drop the teaser poster of this sports film.

 He captioned the poster as, #MaidaanTeaser - Get ready for Maidaan! 27th November 2020 ⚽.

 Speaking about Maidaan, director Amit Sharma earlier told PTI, It is a story of a person who has done a lot. I am not calling it a biopic, I am calling it the golden era of Indian football. The film is about that. So the challenge is how to make this in the best way.

 He further added, The scale is bigger, football is there, sports is there, but it wont be going in the cliche zone. We are trying to give it a fresh perspective. Thats the challenge.

 Earlier, Ajay Devgn, who is playing the role of a football coach in the film, said that he is flattered and honoured to work with the Badhaai Ho director.

 Initially, South actress Keerthy Suresh was supposed to make her Bollywood debut with this Ajay Devgn starrer. However, the actress opted out of the film as the makers felt she looked too young for her part in the movie. Priyamani replaced her in the film.

1786,0,Tamil ,xyz,"The latest exhibition from David Zwirner happened in Paris last October, at a brand new location, that easily succeeded in grabbing the attention of celebrities and art connoisseurs alike. Twenty-six years after opening his first gallery in New York–followed by two more (in London and Hong Kong), the Germany-based gallerist has built another pavilion in Paris, on Vieille-du-temple street, a strategic location in the heart  	of Marais.

 With a combined annual turnover of nearly $500 million, the fashion gallery business has been really good for David, who has worked hard on designing the latest premises very cleverly, ensuring a large central space and three other rooms, for a more intimate stroll. The decision to build here was an obvious one, and a long time dream of the gallery owner. “Paris is a beautiful city that has consolidated its contemporary perspective, thanks to the plethora of museums that raise artistic curiosity amongst viewers. I had been thinking about building a gallery here for a while. Brexit has certainly been an accelerator. From November, my gallery in London will be a British gallery, not a European one. I am a European and I want to remain so,” said David on 14th October, when he presented his recent space to the press.

 The opening exhibition wasn’t a flashy affair, but instead focused on the paintings of the American  artist Raymond Pettibon, who has not been exhibited in the French capital since 1995. Pieces from his collection were showcased in  a heady  constellation. Surrounding him is a collection curated from around sixty artists and prestigious estates. This focus on art is a good omen for the future, as Zwirner promises even more exciting and stimulating exhibitions in the coming time, including the announced arrival of White Cube and Hauser & Wirth.

 At this particular event, Zwirner was accompanied by the local directors: Justine Durrett, who was the sales manager for David in NY, along with the previous owners, Victoire de Pourtalès and Hélène Nguyen-Ban from the VNH gallery.

 We are still some time away from seeing a possible Roger Federer vs Novak Djokovic battle on the tennis court in the ongoing Australian Open 2020 but the two stalwarts of the sport won several hearts on social media with their adorable gesture towards a young girl fan who had hurt her leg.

 In a video shared by the official Twitter account of ATP Tour, both Djokovic and Federer were spotted seen signing the cast of the young girl who was on wheelchair having hurt her left leg. It wasnt just the World No. 2 and World No. 3 mens singles players who signed the girls cast. Earlier, World No. 1 Rafael Nadal had also done the same.

 I will sign next to Rafa (Rafael Nadal), Federer was heard saying on the video shared by ATP Tour. Djokovic, on the other hand, drew a duck on the girls cast. Here are the videos:

 Both Djokovic and Federer have qualified for the quarter-finals of the Australian Open 2020, although in a slightly different process. While Djokovic, the defending champion, has been steamrolling past his opponents, Federer is being tested in virtually every round.

 If both Federer and Djokovic managed to beat their opponents in the respective last 8 matches, they will face each other in the semi-finals.

 Federer, meanwhile, hasnt been as convincing en route to the quarter-finals of the mens singles event. He scraped through against John Milman and Marton Fucsovics in the third and the fourth round battles, respectively.

 Djokovic meanwhile, has won all of his matches until the quarter-finals without dropping a single set. It remains to be seen how he fares against Milos Raonic in the quarters next.

1788,0,Gujarati,abc,"Hamilton: Batting coach Vikram Rathour on Tuesday called the new generation of Indian cricketers incredible and said the team management has already identified the core of players for the T20 World Cup in October-November.

 File image of Vikram Rathour. AP

 Rathour was speaking ahead of the third T20I between India and New Zealand at Seddon Park on Wednesday, with the Men in Blue leading the five-match series 2-0.

 Adjustments will keep going on till the last minute. But as far as I am concerned and the team management is concerned, we have the core. We know what our team is going to be. Unless there is a case of injury or really bad loss in form, I dont see many changes happening, said Rathour.

 With one eye on T20 World Cup in Australia, India have been on experimentation mode since the start of the home season in September last year, giving opportunities to host of youngsters, including Shreyas Iyer, Washington Sundar, Deepak Chahar, and Shivam Dube.

 The T20 team has been doing really well in New Zealand and the young guns have contributed significantly to its success, leaving the batting coach hugely impressed.

 This new generation of cricketers is incredible. I find it amazing actually that they turn up and they are at their best straightaway across different formats, different grounds, and different countries actually. The amount of time they took to get settled (in New Zealand) was outstanding, he said.

 India won the twin matches in Auckland thanks to brilliant outings from KL Rahul and Iyer. The batting coach expressed satisfaction that the younger batsmen are stepping forward for the teams cause.

 The more opportunities that these guys get, they are showing that they are capable. They are showing that they are match-winners on their day. That will help the team, of course, but it will also help their confidence.

 Having seen KL (Rahul) and Shreyas as young cricketers coming through, in my mind, I have absolutely no doubt that they are match-winners. They are getting their opportunities now and they are showing the world what they are capable of, that is great to see, he said.

 Rathour feels Iyers mindset makes him a better player.

 Apart from having those (batting) skills, I think the mindset is amazing. He (Iyer) believes he is a big player, and he is, without any doubt. He genuinely believes that he is a match-winner and he is here to stay. And that mindset, I think, helps him, that is the biggest advantage he has, he said.

 When asked about the ability of the current generation to learn from the IPL whilst maintaining percentage shots as big hits, Rathour said, Big power-hitters and all, that time was there initially, people used to think T20 is more to do with power-hitting but its not the case anymore. Proper cricketing shots, you still get value for shots.

 Talking about the adaptation needed from one format to another, the coach said: Players play so much cricket these days, all three formats consistently, day-in, day-out, they are making these adjustments on their own. The game of cricket has changed with time. Even in Test cricket, big shots are common. I dont think it is that big a difference.

 It is more of a mindset thing and about game plan. As a coach, I dont think we really need to tell them anything. They are doing it on their own. They are stronger, fitter than from our generation. You can see that they are hitting big sixes and without any effort, that way the game has changed.

 The next three games at Hamilton, Wellington and Mt Maunganui will be played at regular-sized grounds unlike Eden Park in Auckland. Rathour hinted that there wont be many alterations to the teams strategy, apart from the bowlers firming up new plans as per conditions on offer.

 You look at the conditions and go. It (Seddon Park) is a bigger ground, it is a regular ground, but we are still looking to play normal cricket, good cricket. I dont think it alters anything. Maybe for the bowlers with their lengths, but with the batters, it doesnt make any difference.

 On bigger grounds (like in Australia), running between wickets will cover the game plan. A good game plan is about players who look at the situation, conditions and accordingly bat. If we play on bigger grounds, I am sure this team is capable of running twos and threes and adjust their game accordingly, he said.

 Since his appointment as batting coach of the senior team, a part of Rathours brief has been to bring up the younger batsmen in the side. In that aspect, he expressed satisfaction in terms of how the younger generation is coming through via A tours.

 They help a lot. In case of any injuries, if you are looking for any replacements, we know players are here, just a city away. They can immediately come in and they are already acclimatised to the conditions. I think thats a great idea and thats working really well for our team.

 The foreign pitches are getting more even and even. There is not that vast a difference now like it used to be earlier. And the amount of cricket these guys are playing, as a coach you cant do anything about not having practice sessions but they are adjusting beautifully.

 Nobody is cribbing, no one is complaining. You dont see anyone talking about grass on the wicket, moisture, etc, he added.

1790,0,Gujarati,abc,"Richa Chadha on Naseer-Anupam row - exclusive interview  |  Photo Credit: Twitter

 Veteran actors Naseerudin Shah and Anupam Kher recently made headlines for making demeaning comments on each other on a public platform. It all started after Naseerudin, went on record to share his views on Bollywoods involvement in the ongoing political tension in our country including the CAA protests and protests against JNU violence. While he supported Deepika Padukones courageous visit to JNU, he passed a disrespectful remark on Anupam Kher by saying, Someone like Anupam Kher has been very vocal. I dont think he needs to be taken seriously. Hes a clown. Any number of his contemporaries from NSD and FTII can attest to his sycophantic nature. Its in his blood, he cant help it.

 This didnt go down well with Anupam Kher who decided to give a befitting reply to Naseerudin Shah through a video saying substances he had been consuming for years had rendered Shah incapable of distinguishing right from wrong. He posted this video on Twitter along with a caption that read: I dont take what you say seriously. Despite being so successful, you have been frustrated all your life. You have criticised Dileep Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Virat Kohli, Rajesh Khanna, Shah Rukh Khan and Virat Kohli. I am sure I am in great company. None of them took you seriously.

 When we recently got to interact with Bollywood actress Richa Chadha, we asked her to comment on this war of words between Anupam Kher and Naseerudin Shah. And Richa, who is one of the very few celebrities who has always been vocal about her political views, said

 I think we shouldnt say anything because they know each other from NSD (National School Of Drama) days and they are talking. So I just dont understand why anyone should say anything about them. Hes saying you are a sycophant and a clown, he is saying you are a victim of substance abuse. So it really does seem personal.

 Further mention how this political tension in the country is creating differences between two veteran actors and the industry on the whole, she added,

 This political tension is not just affecting the industry, its affecting families. People have stopped talking to extended families because their views are different. I have had to quit WhatsApp groups where I feel like people are toxic. So this is why they say the personal is political. Theres no such thing as politics that exits in a vaccum. Its happening everyday. Its how we live, how we choose. Is it not interference in your life when you get a million calls saying link your Aadhar? It is data surveillance in my opinion, its terrible.

 Elaborating on why everyone needs to speak up, Richa concluded,

 When everything in your life is affected by political decisions, policies that are made, how can we say that we can remain apolitical? I was not political 4-5 years ago but now I am because I dont see a choice. With this whole Citizenship thing, the country is so impoverished and so polluted that people are saying forget about Citizenship. The high network individuals, the numbers who have left this country in the last year alone, look up whats happening....Its a massive brain drain. When the best economists are saying look at their economy, its an embarassment. So I am saying instead of fixing all that, you are talking about citizenship, I cant take you seriously because your priorities seem to be wrong. Its like I know my boat is drowning but I am just going to put some more lipstick on.

 Do you agree with Richas point of view?

 The policy is being worked out by the logistics division under the commerce ministry, they added.

 The policy, which also aimed at reducing the high transaction cost of traders, may propose setting up of a central portal, which will provide end-to-end logistics solutions to companies.

 The portal will be a single-window marketplace to link all stakeholders.

 The proposed policy will also focus on increasing the warehousing capacity, and identify gaps that could be bridged to bring down the cost of logistics for traders.

 Besides, there is a proposal to create a national logistics e-marketplace as a one-stop marketplace for exporters and importers, set up a separate fund for start-ups in the logistics sector and to double employment in the sector.

 High logistics cost impacts the competitiveness of domestic goods in international markets.

 The sources said that effective implementation of the policy would help provide an impetus to trade, enhance export competitiveness, and improve Indias ranking in the Logistics Performance Index.

The two began dating soon after and got engaged just six months later in May 2000. They got married in April 2001 (without signing a prenup) and have been together ever since.

The couple have been together through a lot of ups and downs in their relationship including sexual assault allegations and were even on the verge of divorce early in their marriage. The assault case was dropped by prosecutors after the accuser decided not to testify at the trial. Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to her for the incident, including an apology to the general public.

 The couple have four daughters - Natalia, Gianna, Bianka and Capri Bryant. Sadly, Gianna Bryant was also alongside Kobe in the helicopter that crashed and passed away along with her father by her side. Kobe Bryant will be survived by wife Vanessa and three daughters - Natalia, Bianka and Capri Bryant. Our prayers and condolences go to Kobe Bryants family, may the legend rest in peace.

 Kobe Bryants 13-year-old daughter Gianna, who died alongside her father in the helicopter crash that claimed the life of the NBA legend, had shown signs that she could further her fathers glittering basketball legacy.

 Bryants eldest daughter, 17-year-old Natalia, prefers volleyball, Bianka is only three and Capri was only born last year.

 So the 41-year-old NBA greats basketball hopes were invested in Gianna.

 The best thing that happens is when we go out and fans would come up to me and shell be standing next to me... and theyll be like, Youve gotta have a boy, you and V. gotta have a boy.

 You gotta have somebody to carry on your tradition, the legacy. She (Gianna) is like, I got this. Im like, thats right, he went on. Yes, you do, you got this.

 She often worked out with her father in the gymnasium of the familys villa in Newport Beach and he took pride in coaching her high school team when his schedule permitted.

 Gianna was on the helicopter that crashed because she was travelling to a tournament in the Los Angeles suburbs to play for her team, called the Mamba Team, after one of her fathers nicknames.

 One of her teammates was also on board the helicopter and was also among the dead.

 And of course, she had introductions that other young girls players could only dream of - her fathers former agent Rob Pelinka introduced her to basketball stars and coaches.

 Derek Fisher, a Lakers teammate of her father and now coach of the WNBA Sparks, had noticed that Kobes steely will to win had rubbed off on Gianna.

 They have the similar demeanor and personality, Fisher said.

1799,0,English,xyz,"Effectively seeking to end the tenure of Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) Chairman Ajay Tyagi, the Finance Ministry has in a quiet move called for applications to fill up the post.

 An order dated January 24 has been issued by the Economic Affairs Division of the Finance Ministry titled, “Filling up the Post of Chairman, Securities and Exchange Board of India”.

 The order invites applications for filling up the post of SEBI Chairman. The Chairman will receive a consolidated pay of Rs 4.5 lakh per annum as recommended by the Seventh Pay Commission, the recommendations of which were accepted by the government in 2016.

 The Chairman shall hold office for not more than 5 years and shall not hold office beyond 65 years, whichever is earlier.

 Applications are to reach by February 10 with annual confidential reports of five years, integrity certificates, vigilance certificates and no penalty certificates.

 It may be pointed out that February 10, 2017 is the date when Tyagi was appointed SEBI Chairman by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) for a five year term. February 10 is also the date when new applications are being invited, exactly three years into Tyagi’s term.

 At that time, Tyagi was Additional Secretary, Finance Ministry. He is an IAS officer of the 1984 batch of the Himachal Pradesh cadre.

 However, soon after his appointment, the government had curtailed his tenure by two years, barely a week after his name was cleared to succeed the incumbent UK Sinha with a five-year term.

1800,0,Hindi,xyz,"Mumbai: Flag carrier Air India has kept one of its 423-seater jumbo planes ready in Mumbai for the evacuation of Indian citizens from Wuhan in China in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak in that country, an official source said on Tuesday.

 The airline is awaiting necessary approvals from the ministries of external affairs and health to operate the special flight, the source said. The health ministry’s nod is required because the operating crew has to fly in a virus outbreak territory.

 “We have kept a Boeing 747-400 ready in Mumbai to operate an evacuation flight to China whenever we get a go ahead from the government,” the source said.

 Some 250 Indians are to be evacuated.

 At a meeting of top secretaries called by the cabinet secretary on Monday, the government decided to be prepared for possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan.

 Accordingly, Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities for evacuation of Indian nationals, mostly students, stuck in Wuhan city. The Ministry of Civil Aviation and Ministry of Health will make arrangements for transport and quarantine facilities respectively, an official release said on Monday.

 Wuhan along 12 other cities have been completely sealed by the Chinese authorities to stop the virus from spreading. The death toll climbed to 80 with 2,744 confirmed cases.

A report published by Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) earlier today, suggests Ring’s Android app sends a ton of personally identifiable information (PII) to third-party trackers without explicit user consent.

 The report suggests the app (version 3.21.1) sends data to four trackers including Facebook’s graph API, a ‘deep linking’ platform called Branch, and analytics firms like AppsFlyer and Mixpanel through encrypted HTTPS standard. The information sent to these trackers includes names, unique device IDs, language preferences, time zones, devices’ IP addresses, and certain user actions, such as when someone interacts with the ‘Neighbors’ section of the app.

 [Read: Mozilla’s report shows just how awful Ring’s privacy practices are]

 A Ring spokesperson told TNW in an email statement that the company has third-party providers evaluate how its app is used, in order to improve the experience for customers:

 Like many companies, Ring uses third-party service providers to evaluate the use of our mobile app, which helps us improve features, optimize the customer experience, and evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing. Ring ensures that service providers’ use of the data provided is contractually limited to appropriate purposes such as performing these services on our behalf and not for other purposes.

 While sending data to third-party services may seem normal, EFF’s report points out that “the danger in sending even small bits of information is that analytics and tracking companies are able to combine these bits together to form a unique picture of the user’s device.”

 Moreover, while Ring says it restricts these companies’ use of your data, the EFF is concerned that those companies aren’t accountable to Ring. Plus, if you bought a camera from Ring, you don’t really want it sending data about you and your habits to multiple other companies, period.

 Last December, an investigation found that Ring’s hardware didn’t have basic safeguards against someone gaining unauthorized access and snooping on you. A report published by Mozilla in September also highlighted holes in the company’s weak privacy measures.

 Mr Martin Schwenk, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer at Mercedes-Benz India said, At Auto Expo 2020, beside launching the AMG GT 4 Door Coupe, unveiling the A-Class Limousine and the New GLA SUV, we also will be launching something unique and never seen before in India.

 Inspired by the success of the V-Class Luxury MPV in India, we will be launching the V-Class Marco Polo Camper. Nothing reflects restlessness and a spirit of adventure better than an exciting road-trip and camping, he added.

 Mercedes-Benz says the V-Class Marco Polo embodies these traits, and blends outdoor ruggedness with the companys world-renowned luxury and technology. Merc expects that the V-Class Marco Polo camper to generate a lot of interest among their existing customers, who already have shown a massive interest to the V-Class luxury MPV models.

 There is no concrete information about features and specification at the moment. The Mercedes-Benz V-Class Marco Polo is currently available in international markets and has been named after the explorer Marco Polo.

 The Marco Polo available in foreign markets feature front seats that swivel, and rear seats that fold flat to make for a bed. The vehicle also features a pop-up roof that reveals an ‘upstairs sleeping space.

 The V-Class Marco Polo features built in wardrobes, drawers, a stove, a sink with fresh and waste water tanks, and a fridge among a host of other elements that make it a mobile home.

 At the heart of the V-Class Marco Polo is a 2.0-litre four-cylinder turbo-diesel engine that produces 234bhp of power and 500Nm of torque, and comes mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission.

 Safety features on the Mercedes-Benz V-Class Marco Polo include brake assist, front and side impact beams, a crash sensor, a centrally mounted fuel tank, attention assist, and hill assist among others.

 Thoughts About The Mercedes-Benz V-Class Marco Polo Launching In India

 Camper-style travel is not an Indian thing. Most folk only use a vehicle to get from place A to B, and live out of hotel or resorts, not their vehicles. While the concept is great, we think India is better off with seven, eight, and nine seater vehicles rather than campers.

He also believed that if parents patiently explained the right behavior to their children, they normally understood.   This however is not completely true! Having seen Neena run out of patience, Avinash decided to take things in his hands. On one occasion, he sat down to talk to Pranav. This is how their conversation went: Avinash-How was your day Pranav? Pranav- Nikhil is such a bad boy. He hit me so hard. I am so angry with him. I will not leave him tomorrow.  Avinash heard out Pranav patiently and then explained-Pranav, you must not get angry with him. Anger is bad. Tomorrow you must become friends with him again. The very next day Pranav had a big fight with Nikhil. Avinash wondered if listening and explaining helped in any way!    True listening involves understanding of feelings Let us explore, what is happening in the little conversation above. Is Pranav really being listened to? Physically yes. However, the process of listening involves more than just listening to the words literally. True listening entails that the listener understands the feelings expressed by the speaker. After understanding the feelings, it is also important to communicate this understanding of the feelings back to the speaker. Here, Avinash could have done this with a statement like- Pranav you really seem to be very angry with Nikhil. This way Pranavs feeling is in a way reflected back to him.  This technique of being able to pick the feeling of the speaker and communicate it back to him in explicit words is known as reflection of feeling. When the appropriate feeling is reflected back to the speaker, he feels understood. And the crux of true listening is that the speaker should feel understood.   Being understood helps the person think rationally A meaningful process takes place after a person feels understood. The energy, which was being used in the feeling of the intense emotions, gets released and becomes available for the thinking processes. The science of counseling believes that every person functions on a fixed amount of energy, which is used for different activities like feeling, thinking etc. When too much energy goes into the area of feeling like the intense anger in Pranavs case, very less is left for the thinking. But when a person is able to express his feelings freely without being judged, he feels understood and is ready to think. So Pranav would have been more receptive to his fathers advice if his anger was not judged with a statement like you must not get angry with Nikhil. Also, if the child is heard and understood, then very often the parents do not even have to give advice. The child then comes up with the correct counsel himself. For e.g.- if Shrutis complaint of feeling hurt due to her teachers scolding is really  listened to and understood, she could come up with an understanding like  But I was talking in class, naturally the teacher will be angry. And of course, Shrutis coming up with this understanding herself would help her more than the parent explaining that she must have done something wrong to be reprimanded by the teacher.   Denied emotions find unhealthy ways of expression  On the flip side, if the childs feelings are denied in the interaction with the parents, the intense emotions are not able find release and the child finds other unhealthy ways of expressing his emotions. In Pranavs case when his anger was not understood, he tried the unhealthy way of expressing his anger by fighting with Nikhil again. The following example of a common situation in homes illustrates this point further: - When a child complains to his parents that they love his sibling more, his feelings are immediately denied with a statement like  You should not feel jealous of your brother/sister.  The child then finds  unhealthy ways of expressing his jealousy by maybe pinching his brother when the adults are not present.  Before summing up, I would like to say that, to be able to listen to and understand children effectively, it is first necessary for parents to accept that it is not wrong to experience negative feelings (like anger, hurt etc). After accepting this, it will be much easier for the parents to help their children deal with the negative emotions in a positive manner. This would go a long way in facilitating healthy emotional development of the child.

1816,0,English,pqr,"India captain Virat Kohli has posted another inspirational workout video on his Instagram handle on Tuesday. Kohli posted a couple of videos, where he could be seen performing a box jump followed by an exercise for the lower abdomen while lifting weights. Kohli’s post has received more than 14 lakh likes and counting.

 In the first video, Kohli has been recorded doing a box jump in slow motion with teammate Rishabh Pant in the background and Ravindra Jadeja holding the box for support. At the completion of the jump, do not miss the India captain’s quick turn of the head towards the camera.

 In the second video, Kohli is seen performing a stiffer exercise – the lying leg raise – which is for the lower abdomen. While already lifting weights, Kohli lifts his legs slowly off the floor until they’re perpendicular to the ground and brings them back down but without touching the ground.

 “Putting in the work shouldn’t be a choice, it should be a requirement to get better. #keeppushingyourself,” read Kohli’s caption.

 Another interesting nugget from the video points towards the gear Kohli is wearing. During both exercises, Kohli is spotted wearing what seems to be a LA Lakers jersey, which could well be a tribute towards the late NBA icon Kobe Bryant, who died in a helicopter crash Monday. Kohli had posted on Insta saying he was heartbroken to know that Kobe and his daughter Gianna were no more.

 Kohli will lead India into the third T20I against New Zealand in Hamilton on Wednesday and a third straight win will seal the series for the visitors.

1817,0,English,abc,"New Zealand legspinner Todd Astle has announced he’s quitting first-class cricket to focus on his limited-overs career. The 33-year-old played five Tests for New Zealand after making his debut in 2012, the most recent being against Australia in Sydney earlier this month.

 Astle says the commitment required to play the longest format is beyond his reach now so now. “Playing Test cricket was always the dream and I’m so honoured to have represented my country and province in the longest form of the game,” Astle said. “Red-ball cricket is the pinnacle, but also requires a huge amount of time and effort. As I’ve got to the back end of my career I’ve found it harder to maintain the level of commitment required to be fully invested in this version of the game.”

 Astle played 119 first-class matches, taking 334 wickets at 32.17 including 13 five-wicket hauls. He also scored 4345 runs at 25.86 including two centuries and 22 half-centuries.

 “I’m really proud of what I’ve been able to achieve with Canterbury and the Blackcaps,” he said. “To have the opportunity to play a Test against Australia at the SCG was an experience I’ll always cherish. I’m excited to now focus all my energy into the white-ball formats, as well as give more time to my young family and new business.”

 New Zealand selector Gavin Larsen paid tributes to Astle’s perseverance. “Todd’s been an absolute stalwart for Canterbury in the Plunket Shield and his first-class record speaks for itself. To prepare and play four-day cricket at such a level for the best part of 15 seasons is a credit to him and his perseverance,” Larsen said.

 He added, “His ability to turn the ball both ways and build pressure always made him a threat with the red-ball in hand. We appreciate this would have been a tough call for Todd and we absolutely support his proactive decision. He wants to get the most out of himself at this stage of his career and spend more time with his family, and those are admirable reasons.”

Sarri had not been back to Naples since being sacked in May 2018 after three successful campaigns, and before moving to Chelsea.

 This season he has taken over eight-time reigning champions Juve, a move seen as a betrayal by his former team, the two-time Serie A runners-up.

 Juventus missed the chance to open up a six-point lead on Inter Milan at the top of the table, after Antonio Contes side were earlier held 1-1 by Cagliari, their third consecutive draw. Inter are three points behind Juve with Lazio a further two points adrift in third after city rivals Roma ended Simone Inzaghis sides 11-match winning streak.

The visitors then held out for nearly an hour but two headers in three minutes from Jesus gave the scoreline a more accurate reflection of the English champions dominance.

 The death toll from a coronavirus outbreak in China has soared to 106 while nearly 1,300 new cases have been confirmed. As of Tuesday, more than 4,000 people have been infected across China, the bulk of them in and around Wuhan. Some reports have stated the symptoms of the infections as runny nose, sore throat, headache, fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, especially for those with weak immune system. There are currently no vaccines available to protect people against the infection that can be transmitted from human to human.

 The deadly coronavirus has also affected people in Australia, Cambodia, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, Canada, United States, France and Germany.

 China on Tuesday postponed the start of the spring semester for schools and universities across the country over concerns about a deadly virus outbreak. The decision came as the death toll from the new coronavirus soared to 106. Students are currently on holiday for the Lunar New Year and the education ministry did not provide a date for teaching to resume.

 In Britain, around 1,500 people who came to the country from the Chinese epicentre of the epidemic in the past two weeks must put themselves in isolation, the UK health minister said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said authorities cannot be 100 percent certain that the virus cannot spread from a person who exhibits no flu-like symptoms.

 Canadian health authorities also confirmed the countrys first case of a deadly coronavirus, and said the patients wife had also tested positive. The womans case is still listed as presumptive, pending final confirmation by a national lab in Winnipeg, officials said. Nearly 20 people are being monitored.

 The patient confirmed to have the virus — a man in his 50s who arrived in Toronto on January 22 from Wuhan, the epicenter of the epidemic — is being treated in isolation in a hospital there. His wife, who traveled with him, also is believed to have contracted the virus and is in self-isolation, David Williams, Ontario provinces chief medical officer, said in a statement.

 The US State Department has encouraged Americans to reconsider any plans to travel to China. The State Department also issued a stern warning for its citizens not to travel to Hubei province, where Wuhan is located. So far, 82 people have died as a result of the virus, all of them in China.

 Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has said it remained unclear if the deadly coronavirus spreading in China and beyond is contagious during its incubation period, before symptoms appear.

 The virus, which can cause a pneumonia-like acute respiratory infection, has in a matter of weeks killed more than 80 people and infected some 2,740 in China, while cases have been identified in more than a dozen other countries. In a fresh report on the new virus, known as 2019nCoV, the UN health agency said current estimates put the incubation period for the virus at between two and 10 days.

 Global stocks and oil also dropped as panicked investors fled risky assets for safer bets gold, bonds, the dollar and the yen, after China warned that a deadly new coronavirus was spreading fast. Luxury goods makers and airlines suffered particularly on equity markets, as Chinese tourist spending is a key factor for them. Shares of energy and technology companies were also weak.

 Grammys 2020 celebration is over, but it looks like the internet isn’t done with it yet as the netizens are still discussing the similarities between Priyanka Chopra’s Grammys outfit with the dress that Jennifer Lopez wore in the same ceremony in 2000. The internet never forgets anything, and on account of their memory, the netizens have trolled Priyanka’s dress on Monday morning. They compared it to Jennifer’s outfit, although the only similarity between Priyanka and Jennifer’s attire is the plunging neckline, and no other feature of the dress is even remotely alike in two costumes. It was a floor-length embellished gown with tassels and a neckline that plunged beneath her navel that Priyanka wore in Grammys 2020.

 Jennifer’s Grammys 2000 dress, green Versace outfit with tropical prints and a deep neckline, on the contrary, was declared iconic after she wore it twenty years ago.

 Akshay’s friend has dismissed the records of fees hike and stated, “Here is a showcasing entertainer’s concept of encouraging a big name’s reasonable value. Akshay is without a doubt the best big name of Hindi performance center utilizing four superhits in 2019 alone. So saying expenses X Y or sum complete isn’t probably going to cause a stir.

 An orange seller from Karnataka, Harekala Hajabba, was announced as one of the receivers of the fourth highest civilian award, Padma Shri Award. The 68-year-old was felicitated by the government for his selfless service to the society.

 To tell you, Harekala is a fruit seller and is educating poor children of his town Newpadapu from the last 10 years in a mosque. Mr. Hajabba has spent his own funds in the school and has helped many poor kids to get the basic education. He saved his money and started a school in 2000 and when the number of students grew, he even took out loans and purchased land for the school.

 Hajabba never went to school to learn and it was an experience with the foreign visitors that made him realize the importance of education and so, he decided to open a school in his town.

 He said, ” A foreign couple came to me and asked me the price of oranges, yet then I didn’t understand what they are trying to inquire as I was not getting their language. In spite of my earnest attempts, I was unable to talk in anything but Tulu and Beary language. The couple left. I felt extremely terrible and felt that this should not happen with anybody of my own town. I understood that education leads to better communication and simultaneously it unites individuals.

 After getting awarded with Padma Shri, Hajabba additionally communicated his wish to set up a pre-university college for the children of his town.

 Kangana Ranaut’s sister and manager Rangoli Chandel is known for passing harsh comments on many actors of the industry. And recently, when her sister Kangana has been awarded Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian award of India, on the eve of Republic Day. But it seems Kangana’s sister Rangoli has decided to bash even the well-wishers of Kangana Ranaut.

 Kangana Ranaut and her sister Rangoli had annoyed Alia Bhatt many times but Alia had constantly respected them and stayed away from them and never wished to lock horns with them. Recently, when Kangana’s name was declared for Padma Shri, Alia Bhatt congratulated her by sending beautiful flowers to her. But Rangoli Chandel took a dig at Alia’s sweet gesture for her sister. She shared the pictures of the flowers sent by Alia on her Twitter handle and bashed the actress.

 Check out Rangoli Chandel’s tweet right here:

 To tell you, this is not the first time when Rangoli has bashed Alia Bhatt. A couple of weeks before, Rangoli bashed Zoya Akhtar’s film  Gully Boy starring Alia Bhatt and Ranveer Singh and termed Alia’s character Safeena as ‘mediocre’.

 Looks like your still a bitch and always will be..and Alia will always be gracious and kind..with the bitchiness you and your sister spewed about her..she still showed what a nice person she is! Considerng u say ur from a humble background but a right ole bitch..

 On the work front, Kangana Ranaut, who was last seen in Judgementall Hai Kya opposite Rajkummar Rao is getting appreciation for her performance in Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari’s ‘Panga’. The movie is based on the life of a female Kabaddi player who makes a comeback into the game after her marriage and motherhood. Panga also stars Jassie Gill, Neena Gupta and Richa Chadha in the pivotal roles.

1833,0,Telugu,xyz,"Ashleigh Barty will play 14th-seeded American Sofia Kenin in the Australian Open semi-finals after the world number one defeated Petra Kvitova in straight sets on Tuesday.

 The top seed and last remaining Australian in the tournament survived a tough opening set to beat the Czech seventh seed 7-6 (8/6), 6-2 and reach the semi-finals for the first time.

 This was revenge for the 23-year-old Barty after two-time Wimbledon champion Kvitova beat her at the same stage last year in Melbourne.

 But the down-to-earth Australian is a better player than 12 months ago, winning the French Open last year and hitting the top of the rankings for the first time.

 “It’s been absolutely incredible. I knew that I had to bring my best today against Petra, and that first set was crucial,” said Barty.

 Barty is attempting to become the first Australian woman since Chris O’Neil in 1978 win the women’s title Down Under.

 Kvitova, 29, who suffered severe injury to her left playing hand in a knife attack at her home in 2016, and Barty went toe-to-toe in a crucial seventh game of the first set.

 In a game stretching to nearly 10 minutes, Barty fought off five break points to hold serve at Rod Laver Arena, to roars of approval.

 In a tense encounter they went to the tie-break, but it was Kvitova who blinked, shanking a forehand long to give Barty the set in 69 high-quality minutes.

 Barty, who once gave up tennis to play professional cricket, clenched her fist. Kvitova tossed her racquet into air.

 Barty pulled away in the second set as Kvitova wilted in the Melbourne sun.

 The Australian sealed the deal with her trademark minimum fuss, booking her spot in the last four with an ace.

1834,0,Hindi,xyz,"Mikel Arteta hailed Arsenal’s “hungry” youngsters after Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah fired their side into the FA Cup fifth round with a 2-1 win against Bournemouth on Monday.

 Arteta turned to youth at Dean Court and Saka, Nketiah and Joe Willock repaid the Arsenal manager’s faith with influential displays that secured a trip to third-tier Portsmouth.

 Saka gave Arsenal an early lead as the 18-year-old full-back bagged his third goal of the season with a superb strike.

 Nketiah got the second before the interval to ensure Arteta took another step towards emulating his FA Cups triumph as an Arsenal player in 2014 and 2015.

 Sam Surridge got one back for Bournemouth in the closing minutes, but it was too late to salvage a replay.

 “I’m very pleased. Always tough to come here and win, we’ve done it with a young team as well,” Arteta said.

 “I have a lot of faith in them. I think they are developing really well. They are willing and hungry and will only get better.”  Languishing in 10th place in the Premier League after failing to win any of their last three games, this was a welcome boost for Arteta as Arsenal built on their hard-fought draw at Chelsea last week.

 It was Arsenal’s third win in eight matches under Arteta in all competitions, with just one defeat in that run.

 It was not all plain sailing by the seaside for Arteta, who added: “We scored two fantastic goals, but after that we became a little bit sloppy and I didn’t like that very much.”  Arteta’s first match in charge of Arsenal was a 1-1 Premier League draw at Bournemouth in December, but his team looked far more accomplished this time, even without several key players.

 With Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang still suspended, 18-year-old striker Gabriel Martinelli started for Arsenal.

 Martinelli had scored in Arsenal’s past two Premier League games to reach 10 goals for the season.

 But the Brazilian isn’t just a poacher and he showed his creative vision as Arsenal made a perfect start in the fifth minute.

 As a 22-pass Arsenal move approached an eye-catching crescendo, Willock’s surge opened up the Bournemouth defence.

 Willock picked out Martinelli, who deftly moved the ball onto Saka when a more selfish player would have shot and he smashed a thunderous drive into the roof of the net from an acute angle.

 Bournemouth outgunned

 Arteta had made five changes from the Chelsea match, with Nketiah making his first Arsenal start since January last year against Blackpool in the FA Cup.

 Nketiah was recently recalled from a loan spell at second-tier Leeds over concerns he wasn’t playing enough, but the 20-year-old showed his potential in the 26th minute as he doubled Arsenal’s lead.

 Unable to contain Willock and Saka, Bournemouth were carved open as the midfielder’s pass found the defender in acres of space on the left.

 Saka’s cross into the six-yard box was perfect for Nketiah and he slotted in his first Arsenal goal since May.

 Completely outclassed for the first 30 minutes, Bournemouth finally had a sight of goal when Harry Wilson’s volley was saved by Emiliano Martinez.

 Arteta’s men didn’t have it all their own way in the second half and Martinez took out his own player when he clattered into Shkodran Mustafi in a bid to catch a cross.

 Mustafi had to be stretchered off as a result of the clash and Arteta said: “We’ll have to assess tomorrow but when Mustafi has to come off normally it is not a good sign.”  The hapless Martinez nearly gifted Bournemouth a goal moments later when he missed with his attempt to punch clear, but Jack Simpson headed just wide of the empty net.

 Surridge punished sloppy defending to tap in from Simon Francis’ cross deep into stoppage time, but Arsenal’s rookies held on.

1835,0,English,pqr,"Sofia Kenin kept her game neat and tidy to see off big-hitting Tunisian Ons Jabeur 6-4 6-4 at the Australian Open on Tuesday and reach her first Grand Slam semi-final.

 The 21-year-old American arrived in Melbourne after a breakthrough 2019 season when she won all three of her WTA singles titles and came in to Tuesday’s clash at Rod Laver Arena with a 3-1 record against Jabeur.

 Perhaps aware she did not have the power to match her opponent, Kenin instead focused on keeping her error count to a minimum.

 Jabeur, the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final, produced 20 more winners than her opponent but Kenin made up for that by maintaining the same gap in unforced errors.

 “I’m super excited, it was a tough match,” said Kenin, whose previous best show at a Grand Slam was the fourth round at Roland Garros last year.

 Kenin capitalised on Jabeur’s faulty groundstrokes to break early in the opening set but the Tunisian got back on serve at 3-3.

 Unforced errors kept hurting Jabeur as Kenin got a second break in the next game but the Tunisian showed plenty of stomach for the fight, saving five set points over two games to keep the 14th seed waiting.

 The 78th-ranked Jabeur, who said she received a call from her country’s president before the match, had her opportunities in the second set but wasted three breakpoint chances in the sixth game with unforced errors.

 She threw her racket away in disgust during the game which lasted close to 10 minutes.

 “It was a tough moment,” Kenin said. “She was playing well, I didn’t know it was 10 minutes but I felt the game was pretty long. I feel like after that I got my momentum and started playing better.”

 Kenin was 40-0 up in Jabeur’s next service game but once again the Tunisian fought back to take it to deuce before two errors on her forehand gave the American the crucial break and a 4-3 lead.

 After both players held serve Kenin converted her first match point when Jabeur, 25, found the net on a service return.

 Kenin will meet either world number one Ash Barty of Australia or twice Wimbledon champion Czech Petra Kvitova for a place in Saturday’s final.

 Mumbai: Flag carrier Air India has kept one of its 423-seater jumbo plane ready in Mumbai for the evacuation of Indian citizens from Wuhan province in China in the wake of Cornovirus outbreak in the East Asian country, an official source said on Tuesday.

 The airline is awaiting necessary approvals from the ministries of External Affairs and Health to operate the special evacuation flight, the source said.

 The decision follows the government instructions to various ministries to take steps to deal with the issue.

 “We have kept a Boeing 747-400 ready in Mumbai to operate an evacuation flight to China whenever we get a go ahead from the government,” the source said.

 Some 250 Indians are to be evacuated, the source said, adding, “we are awaiting clearances from Ministry of External Affairs and also from Health Ministry. The Health Ministry’s nod is required because the operating crew has to fly in a virus outbreak territory.”

 At the Cabinet Secretary meeting on Monday, the government decided that steps may be taken to prepare for the possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan.

 Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus in China is a novel strain and not seen before.

 The outbreak has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome).

 Accordingly, Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities while the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Ministry of Health will make arrangements for transport and quarantine facilities respectively, an official release had said on Monday.

 Government also asked the Civil Aviation Ministry to issue instruction to airlines for managing and notifying anybody reporting illness on all direct and indirect flight to China besides facilitating in-flight announcements and distribution of health cards to all flights with direct or indirect connectivity to China.

 Officials said Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities for evacuation of Indian nationals, mostly students, stuck in Wuhan city.

 “It was decided that steps may be taken to prepare for possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan. Accordingly, Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities,” a government statement said.

 Wuhan along 12 other cities have been completely sealed by the Chinese authorities to stop the virus from spreading. The death toll climbed to 80 with 2,744 confirmed cases.

 Over 250 to 300 Indian students are reportedly stuck in Wuhan triggering concerns over their well-being.

 According to the World Health Organisation, the common symptoms of the virus strain include respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties.

 When you press the button on the EVM, do it with such force that the current is felt at Shaheen Bagh, Amit Shah said while campaigning for the BJP ahead of the Delhi election. ‘Prevent a thousand Shaheen Baghs’ was his message. Then law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad called a press conference to accuse Arvind Kejriwal of standing with Shaheen Bagh protesters.

 Clearly, Shaheen Bagh is no longer just the name of a locality or a local site of protest. It has already etched its name on the global stage with the likes of Tahrir Square in Egypt, Taksim Square in Turkey, and Wall Street in New York. Every night Shaheen Bagh persists, it creates more of itself in different corners of India. More Shaheen Baghs – such as in Park Circus in Kolkata, Ghanta Ghar in Lucknow, and Mosque Road in Bengaluru.

 As one placard reads: “You divide, we multiply”.

 Also read: Modi-Shah’s Delhi dislike found its new target just in time for election – Shaheen Bagh

 Be it Shaheen Bagh or any of the other sit-ins against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, it is clear that these are not ordinary protest sites. No pliant audience sits listening to political speeches and disperses soon after, leaving just flyers on the road. At any point during the day, Shaheen Bagh is alive. Children sit with mothers, grandmothers sit near the stage, food is brought in from homes, art is made, songs are sung.

 Ignoring the armed police who loom like dementors, protesters have turned Shaheen Bagh into a site for the fearless and the determined. Revolution, after all, is a carnival of people power.

 Some cynics ask, ‘What have the protests achieved and can they change Narendra Modi and Shah’s plans?’ For the first time since Independence, the Muslims of India have found a language, a new grammar of politics to articulate their pain and their aspirations. For the first time in the last five years of Modi rule, those who could not step out after each lynching, those who had to keep quiet after the unjust Ayodhya verdict, those who have been overtaken by fear and despair, are speaking up. A muted community is speaking up for itself. The Muslim youth and women in these sit-ins today are more aware, more up to date, more informed, more critical, more conscious than the average Indian studying in ‘WhatsApp university’. This, for me, is the biggest achievement yet of our collective fight back.

 Also read: Who represents India’s Muslims? Thanks to CAA protests, we now know the answer

 For far too long, Muslims have been reduced to a silent vote bank, advised to lie low and let others fight for them. These ‘others’ can be self-proclaimed secularists, liberals and even anti-caste warriors. While many of them are genuine well-wishers of the community, some just wanted to satiate their self-interest at the cost of Muslims and win votes. Muslims should remain silent, they would say, or else it will only end up helping the Hindutva-wadis polarise society. And we listened to their advice for many decades now.

 What has this tactic achieved for Muslims or for India? Has their silence checked the polarisation of India? Could the unbridled rise of fascism be contained? Did it save secularism? By avoiding association with Muslims, could the opposition make a dent in the vote count of the BJP? Far from political security, it also did not guarantee social or economic security.

 The illiteracy rate is the highest among Muslims (42.7 per cent) compared to any other community – SC, ST or OBC. Muslims have the lowest rate of enrollment in higher education, lower than even other marginalised communities. In an economy where job security is eroding fast, Muslims are perhaps the worst hit. The Sachar Committee, the Ranganath Misra Committee and the Amitabh Kundu Committee – one after the other attested to the profound deprivation of the largest minority in India. Their share in salaried employment, in government jobs, in police, in army or among industrialists are all disproportionately low. The only place we are over-represented are in India’s jails.

 So, how did our silence help?

 Also read: Amit Shah raises Shaheen Bagh in Delhi election: BJP’s desperation or trump card?

 Today, through the CAA protests, Muslims are not just speaking, they are also rewriting politics. Contrary to mainstream political thought, Muslims aren’t a vote block or a homogeneous community. But with these protests, many dormant emotions (or forcefully suppressed ones) have been set in motion in the Muslim community. So much so that even those who have occupied centre stage “representing” the community for far too long are being challenged from within. And by whom? The most marginalised Muslim voices – that of the women and the young.

 This internal influx is bothering those parties or people who want to deal with Muslims as a monolithic vote bank and then use them again as bait to stereotype the community. This symbiotic relationship between the system and traditional spokespersons has been unsettled. Top-down Muslim politics has been shaken from voices on the ground.

 A secular intellectual wrote an article after the Ayodhya judgment, chiding Muslims in the most patronising tone about how they were complicit in the final verdict. According to Javed Anand, by protesting the Shah Bano judgement and getting it reversed, the Muslims were complicit in ‘giving’ an agenda to the Hindu Right. While giving the Muslims his unsolicited advice, he, however, has no words for the Rajiv Gandhi government, which made the All India Muslim Personal Law Board the “sole representative” of the Muslims in India. Would the AIMPLB have overthrown or challenged the Congress government? Far from it. But still the Congress government chose to do what it did, because it always suited power to impose top-down control on Muslims.

 The history of Indian politics is replete with instances where the Muslim community has been arm twisted by secular parties into silence. But we won’t be blackmailed any more.

 Also read: Tricolour, anthem — India’s Muslims on why they’re using national symbols in protests

 Yes, we are secular. But our fight for secularism will not be decontextualised, we will not operate within frameworks that obfuscate the inequalities and contradictions faced by Muslims. By fighting against the CAA-NRC-NPR, we have begun a fight not just to safeguard secularism but also to ensure social justice. And we shall not stop at simply safeguarding our citizenship. We have the right to be Muslims and still be equal citizens of India.

 This is a moment akin to the Black civil rights movement. We are at the cusp of a possibility. Possibility of being equal again.

 Tokyo: Byte, a new video-sharing app released Friday to compete with ByteDance Inc.’s TikTok, has rocketed to the top of Apple Inc.’s U.S. App Store.

 Created by Dom Hofmann, Byte reboots the deprecated Vine video-sharing service, which he co-founded in the summer of 2012 and sold to Twitter Inc. later that year. The parent company failed to find a way to make the service profitable and eventually discontinued it in 2016. Despite its brief existence, Vine became a cultural touchpoint in the U.S., with many users embracing its six-second time limit as a creative challenge. It was where controversial YouTube star Logan Paul, whose channel now has more than 20 million subscribers, got his start.

 Byte “ended Friday as the No. 1 free iPhone app on the U.S. App Store and is still in the top spot,” said Randy Nelson of research firm Sensor Tower. Beside the U.S., Byte is also the top free iOS app in Canada and ranks in the top 10 in Australia, New Zealand, Norway and the U.K. On Android’s Play Store, Byte is sixth among free apps in the U.S.

 The new app was downloaded more than 780,000 times over the weekend, with three quarters of those installs coming from the U.S., Sensor Tower estimated on Monday.

 The timing of Byte’s release coincides with a moment of reckoning for TikTok and its Beijing-based parent company. ByteDance is looking to hire a chief executive officer for TikTok, which is under increasing scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers wary about the influence of Chinese companies on American consumers. TikTok’s runaway popularity has been deemed to create “national security risks,” according to a letter by Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton in the fall.

 Unlike ByteDance, which is the world’s highest-valued startup, and most other social media contenders, Byte is starting off small and its community guidelines make several references to the company’s modest budget. Still, the strong early response to Byte’s arrival — coming with little to no advance fanfare — suggests the community that Vine built up remains loyal to the particular six-second format. Some of the early popular videos on the platform are humorous proclamations of “Don’t post TikToks here.”

 Chandigarh: The BJP-Jannayak Janata Party (JJP) alliance in Haryana seems to be on a shaky ground.

 After senior JJP leader Ram Kumar Gautam resigned criticising party chief Dushyant Chautala, JJP MLA from Tohana Devender Babli has once again accused state BJP chief Subhash Barala of corruption and demanded a probe into alleged irregularities in expenditure.

 Last week, independent MLA from Meham Balraj Kundu had also accused a senior BJP leader of corruption.

 On Sunday, Babli — considered a close aide of Deputy Chief Minister Dushyant Chautala — reiterated his corruption charges against Barala. Speaking to a local TV channel, he pointed to alleged irregularities in expenditure made under various grants during Barala’s stint as a Tohana MLA.

 Earlier this month, Babli had said Barala did little for the constituency, even as the latter claimed to have spent thousands of crores for its development.

 “If some officers think they can get away by getting transferred out from this place (Tohana), it will not work. It has come to my notice that many bills were passed for works that were never carried out in the constituency. All of this will be probed,” he added.

 ThePrint tried to contact Barala for his comments. This report will be updated when he responds.

 Babli had defeated Barala in Tohana assembly constituency in the elections last year and is among the 10 JJP MLAs (including Dushyant Chautala) who later allied with the BJP to help form the government.

 BJP had won 40 seats in the 90-member house.

 Babli’s statement came days after Kundu accused senior BJP leader Manish Grover of corruption. At a press conference on 24 January, Kundu alleged losses to the tune of Rs 3,300 crore suffered by the state’s cooperative sugar mills because of a scam involving Grover.

 Grover had later sent a legal notice to Kundu for criminal defamation.

 This isn’t the first time that the months-old BJP-JJP alliance has suffered a major setback. Upset with the party’s functioning, senior JJP MLA Ram Kumar Gautam resigned as the party vice-president last month.

 Gautam was among the founders of the JJP when it broke away from the Indian National Lok Dal last year. Going public with criticism of Dushyant, Gautam had alleged that the deal between the BJP and the JJP was signed without the deputy CM taking any of his MLAs into confidence.

 Tohana MLA Babli has now said even though JJP was part of the government it didn’t mean the “wrongs” done by those in the BJP earlier could not be pointed out.

 Accusing Barala of arrogance, the JJP MLA said: “Even Ravan was arrogant and power drunk, and he too had a fall. If such people are doing wrong…we will be the first to call them out. These people, who had lost the mandate of the public but continue to occupy positions of power, are trying to scare officers.”

 Babli’s entire election campaign last year was focused on attacking Barala and the fact that the latter was not to fulfill the promises he had made to his electorate despite being the BJP state chief.

 BJP and JJP had agreed to form the government in Haryana after Dushyant was made the deputy chief minister and his party given two additional posts — that of a cabinet minister and a minister of state.

 However, besides Dushyant, the only other minister from the JJP quota in the Manohar Lal Khattar cabinet at present is Anoop Dhanak, a two-time MLA, who is looking after a low profile ministry of Archaeology and Museums (independent charge) and Labour and Employment (attached with the deputy CM) as Minister of State.

The drone was spotted twice following which BSF personnel from the 136th Battalion opened fire at it to bring it down, the officials said here.

 Similarly, on January 18, a drone-like object was spotted flying over a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp in Chhattisgarhs naxal-affected Sukma district, an official said. Similar light-emitting objects had been spotted flying near camps of CRPF in the district thrice in October last year. A drone-like object was sighted for about 15 minutes in the sky over the Puswada camp of the CRPF on the highly-sensitive Dornapal-Jagargunda axis on Friday night, Sukma Superintendent of Police Shalabh Sinha told PTI.

 We launched our UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle or drone) to track its movement. However, the light of the suspected drone went off and it disappeared, he added. The object was similar to those seen flying over security forces camps in Kistaram and Pallodi area of the district in October, the SP said. The objective was to show their strength to the cadres and motivate them, the official added. Flying drones over camps could also be intended to create a psychological pressure on the security forces, he said.

1847,0,Telugu,xyz,"After creating much buzz among the audiences, the makers of Maidaan starring Ajay Devgn have unveiled the teaser poster of the film.

 On early Tuesday, Tanhaji actor Ajay Devgn took to his official Instagram handle to share the teaser poster of his upcoming film with his fans. In the poster, one can see some football players standing with the football in hand. The scenario seems to be set on a rainy day as one can see sludge all over the place. Sharing the poster, Devgn wrote, “#MaidaanTeaser – Get ready for Maidaan! 27th November 2020 (sic).”

 Helmed by Badhaai Ho director Amit Ravindernath Sharma, the film is based in the golden years of Indian football. Ajay will essay Syed Abdul Rahim who served as coach and manager of the Indian football team from 1950 until his death in 1963. He is also regarded as the architect of modern Indian football.

 The makers shot for an important football sequence of the film for which a massive set was built in Mukesh Mills, Mumbai. The makers even got the VFX team and the sports choreographer from Los Angeles to get the most out of the football sequence.

 Keerthy Suresh, who was earlier roped in to play the character of a mother, left the project as the makers felt that she looked ‘too young’ for the role. Southern beauty Priyamani will make her Bollywood debut with Ajay Devgn-starrer sports drama Maidaan.

 Maidaan is produced by Zee Studios, Boney Kapoor, Akash Chawla and Arunava Joy Sengupta. Saiwyn Quadros and Ritesh Shah have been credited for screenplay and dialogues, respectively.

 The film is scheduled to be released on November 27.

 “Lakhs of people gather there (Shaheen Bagh). People of Delhi will have to think and take a decision. They will enter your houses, rape your sisters and daughters, and kill them. There’s time today, Modiji (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) and Amit Shah will not come to save you tomorrow. It will be a whole lot better if the people of Delhi wake up today,” Verma told news agency ANI.

 The BJP MP from West Delhi alleged that the Shaheen Bagh protesters could harm residents to Delhi and urged people to wake up “while there’s time.”

 Pitching for the BJP in the upcoming Delhi election, he went on to claim that the ongoing protests at Shaheen Bagh will come to an end within one hour if BJP forms the government in the national capital.

 “If the BJP forms government on February 11, not a single person will be found at (the protest site) Shaheen Bagh,” Verma said during a meeting at Vikaspuri assembly constituency.

 In another provocative statement, the BJP leader said, “If our government is formed, then give me just a month after February 11, and I will remove all mosques built on government land in my Lok Sabha constituency.”

 Upping the ante against the Delhi government, Verma said, “Arvind Kejriwal says he is with Shaheen Bagh and so does Manish Sisodia. The people know that a fire engulfed Kashmir in which their mothers and sisters were raped. This happened in Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Hyderabad.”

 Protests have been ongoing in different parts of the country, including Shaheen Bagh in the national capital, against the amended Citizenship Act (CAA) which grants citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Buddhists and Christians fleeing religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh if they entered India on or before December 31, 2014.

 India does not have a reason to worry on the count that these resolutions are non-binding and legally don’t count for anything. But what should worry India is that this further damages India’s image abroad as a secular, liberal and egalitarian society that does not discriminate on the basis of religion. What should also worry India is these resolutions have been moved from varied lawmakers, ranging from the left to right ideological spectrum.

 The main resolution is sponsored by the centre-right European People’s party which is the largest bloc in the EP. The second biggest one is backed by the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists. Both these resolutions say “an effective national asylum and refugee policy should be just and holistic in nature and is not discriminatory”.

 The resolutions sponsored by the more left-wing parties like the Greens and Social Democrats rubbishes the CAA for creating the ‘largest statelessness crisis in the world’.

 The move by the European parliament is a direct infringement into the internal affairs of India. Which is why the Speaker of the Lok Sabha Om Birla wrote to his European counterpart urging him that it is “inappropriate for one legislature to pass judgement on another. A practice that can be surely misused by vested interests.” It would also set a bad precedent, he wrote.

 What’s to stop India from passing resolutions on the rise of anti-immigrant sentiment in Europe in our Lok Sabha? It would lead to a needless cycle of trying to play holier than thou.

 The European Parliament is also a largely toothless body whose opinion may or may not have a bearing on the actual decision making bodies of the European Union, which are the European Council and the European Commission.

 Which is perhaps why the European Union spokesperson Virginie Battu-Henriksso distanced the Union from the resolutions brought forth in Parliament. She said “the opinions expressed by the European Parliament do not represent the official position of the European Union”.

 Both of these bodies realise the importance that India brings with it as a trading partner and as one of the biggest markets in the world for European goods and services. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is due to visit Brussels in mid-March for the 15th annual India-EU summit. He could expect his European interlocutors to wink and nudge him on both CAA and Article 370. It would make for ‘bad optics’ at worst.

 But one thing India can’t fault the Europeans for is this. It is India that went courting Members of the European Parliament by taking them on a ‘sponsored trip’ to Kashmir. Why should India care about the opinion of such inconsequential MEPs that it had to roll the red carpet out for them? One of those MPs who was part of the delegation that visited Kashmir is also one of the co-sponsors of one of the six resolutions.

1851,0,English,abc,"Bengaluru: The Kempegowda International Airport, Bengaluru (KIAB or BLR Airport) welcomed 33.65 million passengers during the calendar year 2019, registering a 4.1 per cent growth, compared to previous years 32.33 million.

 While international passenger traffic witnessed double-digit growth of 14.0 per cent, an upswing from 4.27 million in CY 2018 to 4.87 million in CY 2019, domestic traffic grew by 2.6 per cent, from 28.05 million to 28.78 million.

 The year 2019 has been a turbulent year for Indian aviation, mostly impacted by the closure of a large airline and supply-side challenges caused by the grounding of some aircraft types, according to a BLR airport statement.

 These factors had a ripple effect as the ATMs at Bengaluru airport were down by 0.1 per cent as against the double-digit CAGR witnessed in the previous five years (CY14 to CY18).

 The total ATMs during 2019 was 235,058 as compared 235,190 in CY 2018.

 Notably, international movements remained on the upswing, growing by 13.0 per cent with a total of 30,556 ATMs as compared to 26,966 ATMs in CY 2018, owing to the launch of new routes and new flights during Winter 2018.

 Domestic movements saw a slump of 1.8 per cent to 204,502 ATMs from 208,224 ATMs in CY 2018.

 Meanwhile, domestic cargo remained positive, registering a 4.1 per cent growth.

 The total domestic cargo processed during this period was 149,603 Metric Tonnes (MT), as against 143,701 MT in CY 2018.

 In the same period, international cargo dropped by 4. 1 per cent, it was stated.

 “The aviation market in India is in recovery mode after a volatile period. We estimate that passenger volumes at BLR Airport will be between 55 to 65 million passengers per annum (mppa) in the next five years.

 To support this growth, BIAL is investing ₹13,000 crore for infrastructure expansion, including the South Runway, which is operational, and the first phase of Terminal 2,” said Hari Marar, MD & CEO, Bangalore International Airport Limited.

 Among the airlines, Indigo continued to lead as their passenger figures, to and from Bengaluru, rose by 13.0 per cent from 13.81 mppa in CY 2018 to 15.61 mppa in CY 2019.

 On the domestic front, Delhi (13,186) and Mumbai (11,801) continued to be the most travelled destinations from Bengaluru while Singapore (1,628) and Dubai (1,488) were the top international cities by annual scheduled passenger movement CY19.

 Seven new destinations and two new international airlines were introduced during the course of the calendar year.

 Two more Japan Airlines to Tokyo and Lufthansa to Munich are set to operate from Summer 2020.

 Currently, Bengaluru is connected to 82 destinations, including 25 international cities.

 Thirty-six passenger airlines (eight domestic and 24 international, including four Indian carriers) operate to and from BLR Airport on a regular basis.

 In addition, there are 14 cargo airlines, including two Indian carriers.

 BIAL has recently entered into an agreement with Phase 1 Events and Embassy Group to manage and operate a Concert Arena, scheduled to be ready by the end of 2021.

 “This multipurpose arena will take entertainment a new level, enabling the coming together of world-class music bands from across the globe, sporting events, expos and exhibitions, round the year,” the statement said.

1854,0,Hindi,abc,"The finance ministry has invited appliations to appoint the next chairman of Securities and Exchange Board of India to succeed Ajay Tyagi, whose three-year term comes to an end in February.

 Tyagi, a 1984 batch IAS officer of Himachal Pradesh cadre, was appointed as SEBI chairman on Mar. 1, 2017, for the period of three years. It was widely expected that Tyagi would get at least two years extension given his stellar performance on the job.

 The public notice dated Jan. 24 inviting application from eligible candidates indicates that the government in not inclined to do so.

 Applications of eligible candidates in prescribed proforma along with attested copies of annual confidential report for the last five years, vigilance clearance and no penalty and integrity certificate in case of serving government employees should reach on or before Feb. 10, according to the public notice issued by finance ministrys economic affairs department.

 The government had given extension to UK Sinha for three years, making him the second longest-serving SEBI chairman.

 In the case of Tyagi, the government issued the appointment notification twice. According to the first notification issued on Feb. 10, 2017, Tyagi, the then additional secretary (investment) in the department of economic affairs, was appointed the SEBI chairman for a period not exceeding five years or till the age of 65 years or until further order, whichever is earlier. Subsequently, another notification curtailed his appointment to an initial period of three years.

 Since age is on his side, Tyagi can apply for the job again. However, this will be considered fresh appointment and not an extension.

 According to the procedure for the appointment of regulators, the candidates will be shortlisted by the financial sector regulatory appointments search committee headed by the cabinet secretary.

 The shortlisted candidates are interviewed by the panel comprising of the economic affairs aecretary and three external members with domain knowledge. Based on that interaction, FSRASC recommends name to the appointments committee of the cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for approval.

1856,0,Telugu,xyz,"Indian Railway Catering & Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) share price rallied 2 percent intraday on January 28 after Prabhudas Lilladher initiated coverage on the stock, with a buy rating and a price target of Rs 1,339, implying 33 percent potential upside.

 The stock has rallied more than 16 percent in the last one month and shot up 221 percent since October 14, 2019, the day it was listed. It was quoting at Rs 1,024.10, up Rs 16.45, or 1.63 percent, on the BSE at 1110 hours.

 We initiate coverage on IRCTC with a buy rating given 1) monopoly position in providing online ticket booking and catering services for passengers travelling by Indian Railways (IRs) 2) high revenue visibility from packaged drinking water segment (Rail Neer brand) aided by 35 percent higher capacity 3) revenue kicker of Rs 670 crore/Rs 700 crore in FY21/FY22 from e-ticketing business post re-introduction of service charge (Rs 15 per ticket for non-AC and Rs 30 per ticket for AC from September 1, 2019) and 4) catering revenue CAGR of 14.5 percent over FY19-22 led by an average increase in mobile/static catering tariffs by around 70/61 percent respectively, the brokerage said.

 Strong balance sheet (net cash of Rs 1,150 crore as on September 2019), healthy return ratios (RoE/RoCE to expand from 27/34 percent in FY19 to 44/52 percent in FY22E) and 45 percent dividend pay-out gives us additional comfort, it added.

 The brokerage says valuations at 20x/18x FY21E/FY22 look compelling, given sales/PAT CAGR of 22.5/48.7 percent over FY19-22 and monopolistic position in ticket booking and catering.

 Prabhudas Lilladher expects tourism revenue/EBIT to grow at a CAGR of 9.1/2.9 percent over FY19-22. IRCTC has footprints across all major tourism segments such as hotel bookings, rail, land, cruise and air tour packages and air-ticket bookings. It has monopoly in rail tourism and operates various theme based trains.

 Policy uncertainty in catering and reduction/abolishment of service charge are key risks to its buy call, it said.

1858,0,Telugu,xyz,"A rally in gold prices came to a halt on Tuesday as a stronger dollar outweighed rising concerns over a new coronavirus that has fuelled demand for safe-haven assets.

 Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,579.38 per ounce by 0456 GMT, after hitting a near three-week peak on Monday. U.S. gold futures edged higher by 0.1% to $1,578.10.

 Gold prices rose for the past four sessions as the spread of the coronavirus rattled financial markets and prompted authorities to impose travel restrictions and extend the Lunar New Year holidays.

 Increasing fears about the economic impact of the new coronavirus is underpinning gold at these $1,580 an ounce levels, said John Sharma, an economist at National Australia Bank (NAB).

 (Gold) could reach $1,600, but would be more around the $1,570-$1,590 levels as we need to get more information, there are a lot of unknown variables around the virus, he said.

 Asian shares extended a global selloff on Tuesday as the death toll from the virus reached 106 in China and some health experts questioned whether Beijing can contain the virus which has spread to more than 10 countries, including France and the United States.

 Gold is considered a safe investment during times of economic and political uncertainty.

 However, the bullions rise was halted by a firmer dollar , which hovered close to a near two-month high hit in the previous session.

 Gold looks to consolidate Mondays gains as a number of traders are off for the Chinese New Year, pinning bullion towards $1,580, MKS PAMP analysts said in a note.

 Investors will focus on the U.S. Federal Reserves first meeting of the year starting on Tuesday, where it is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged.

 Lower interest rates reduce the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.

 Holdings of the worlds largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, SPDR Gold Trust, fell 0.13% to 899.41 tonnes on Monday.

 In other precious metals, palladium advanced 1.4% to $2,299.96 an ounce, after declining as much as 7% in the previous session.

 Silver fell 0.2% to $18.05, while platinum rose 0.4% to $987.73.

1859,0,Gujarati,abc,"After three rockets slammed into the US embassy in Baghdad on Sunday in the first direct hit reported after months of close calls, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday urged Iraqi Prime Minister Adil Abdel Mahdi to uphold his country’s “sovereignty” in the face of “attacks” from Iran on US facilities in Iraq.

 Pompeo “expressed his outrage at the continued assaults by Iran’s armed groups against US facilities in Iraq, including yesterday’s rocket attacks against our Embassy, which resulted in one injury,” the State Department said in a statement.

 None of the attacks have been claimed but Washington has repeatedly blamed Iran-backed military factions in Iraq. On Sunday, one rocket hit an embassy cafeteria at dinner time while two others landed nearby, news agency AFP reported.

 The statement said that “these attacks demonstrate a wanton disregard for Iraqi sovereignty and a failure to rein in these dangerous armed groups.” Pompeo said on Twitter that “the government of #Iraq must take immediate steps to protect our diplomatic facilities as required by international law.”

 As I emphasized in our conversation, the Government of #Iraq must take immediate steps to protect our diplomatic facilities as required by international law.

 Since the US assassinated Iran’s Quds Force leader General Qasem Suleimani and Iraqi military figure Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis earlier this month in Baghdad, Iraq has become the battleground for both Iran and the US. Iran was prompted to fire ballistic missiles at an Iraqi base where US troops are stationed.

 Rajinikanth is one of those who never shy away from trying new things. The superstar is all set to feature in the next episode of Man vs Wild India edition. The popular adventure show hosted by Bear Grylls had also featured Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year. For the episode, Rajinikanth is shooting in the Bandipur forest. For the same, the actor arrived in Mysore yesterday and he will be joined by Bear Grylls today.

 While Thalaivas fans are excitedly waiting to see him in action, some concerns over how the permission was given for the shoot have come up. Environmentalists have raised concerns over shooting in the reserved forest zone. The forest officials, however, say that due diligence has been done.

 In August last year, PM Modi featured in Man vs Wild. Bear Grylls went on an adventure trip with PM Modi to the Jim Corbett National Park. During the episode, which created history by clocking highest viewership and made Discovery Channel one of the most viewed channels in slot viewership, PM Modi was seen crossing a river on a raft with Bear and handling an improvised spear.

 Talking about films, Rajinikanths latest release Darbar has been ruling the box office. Helmed by AR Murugadoss, the movie hit the screens earlier this month. It also features Nayanthara, Thomas and Sunil Shetty in the lead roles. Woven around a police officer, who is on a chase to hunt down a dreaded gangster for fulfilling his own secret agenda, Darbar has been apparently made on a budget of Rs 200 crore.

 The superstar is now working on his upcoming project Thalaivar 168. The yet-untitled movie is being made under Sun Productions and Siruthai Siva is directing it. Although the makers have been tight-lipped about the film, it has been revealed that Keerthy Suresh will be essaying the role of Thalaivas daughter.

1866,0,English,pqr,"Soon, there might be a new type of stretchable battery that can power the upcoming wearable devices. Researchers at Stanford have invented a new type of soft and stretchable battery that will power next-gen wearables.

 The new type of battery basically relies on a special type of plastic to store power. The researchers claim that the process is safer than the flammable formulations used in conventional batteries.

 “Until now we haven’t had a power source that could stretch and bend the way our bodies do, so that we can design electronics that people can comfortably wear,” said chemical engineer Zhenan Bao, who teamed up with materials scientist Yi Cui to develop the device.

 For some time, lithium-ion batteries have used polymers as electrolytes, which is basically the energy source that transports negative ions of the battery to the positive pole. However, the polymer electrolytes come with gels that, in some cases, could leak or burst into flame.

 In order to combat this, the Stanford researchers have developed a polymer that is sold in nature and it is stretchable. The material is still able to carry an electric charge between the battery’s poles.

 The researchers have revealed that the experimental battery maintained a constant power output even when squeezed, folded and stretched nearly twice its original size. Currently, the prototype is a thumbnail-sized material and it stores roughly half as much energy as found in a similarly sized conventional battery. The researchers are working to increase the density of the stretchable battery and they will run future experiments to demonstrate its performance outside the lab.

What will the future of the industry look like, since we’re already seeing fashion houses scale down on jobs that can be automated, such as fashion buying? Abdullah Abo Milhim, programme leader, MA Fashion Business, Istituto Marangoni London, visited Mumbai recently, and spoke with

 about the tectonic shift in fashion and retail, thanks to technology.

 Q. How can big data and artificial intelligence be integrated within business models in the fashion world?

 Artificial intelligence and big data are not new. But what we are now seeing is that retail, in general, has only now started asking big questions about how we can use them. Businesses have started feeling that disruption is coming from consumers. They are telling companies what they want, using technology—what we call personalisation.

 Previously, technology was one of the aspects that could change the business model; now, technology drives the entire business model. While some brands have started making the shift, it can take years. The problem is that one needs to create a culture around digital, where people accept technology, have the skills and mindset around that. We are seeing a number of brands now collaborating with technology companies to do these things.

 Q. At a time like this, when artificial intelligence and machine learning can create automated designs, how relevant is the artist?

 This continues to be a grey area. In the retail sector, people are raising questions about whether jobs such as fashion buying and artists will be relevant in the near future. There is so much fear and panic that departments like fashion buying are now closing at universities; department stores are restructuring themselves to need fewer fashion buyers.

 However, I subscribe to the other view, that technology is just another edge; it is not something that will replace the DNA of fashion. I think the companies that will fail the fashion industry are ones who get driven so much with technology that they forget about this DNA.

 We can shift from using traditional methods to using technology. But we do need people to expand their knowledge and skills in data analytics and understand how they are relevant for that industry. Instead of seeing these technologies as something that will destroy our jobs, we need to be much more open minded and look at it as something that will create future jobs.

 Q. What will the impact of big data be on design, demand and resale in the fashion industry?

 Big data is stored, analysed and makes predictions simultaneously. It has the ability to do bring all the aspects of fashion together in real time, collaboratively. The conversation is no longer about moving from one channel to another. This means that instead of design, resale and demand being three different parts, it is all part of one large network now. So data can be prescriptive, descriptive, but also can be predictive, and the future is about predictive.

 Q. How have these technologies helped with new value chain strategies?

 Historically, in the value chain, one of the supporting activities is data or digital, but we feel that this value chain structure needs to be a little reconfigured. So data, instead of being one of the resources that the company has, is becoming one of the drivers of the whole supply chain. Data is branching out from what it used to be, dividing the value chain into three parts: Finding the data, storing the data and analysing the data. Maybe were going to have another edge, the ability of the data to have cognitive skills, which enable it to take decisions based on analysis.

 Q. Some global trends in the fashion industry…

 Big data is now showing us new ways of trend forecasting. In fashion, trends used to be the most valuable, and we wanted to know them in advance. Now, however, trends are no longer fundamental issues, because each consumer is different. The focus is on becoming more personalized, more individualistic. Millennials want to see a lot of personalisation in everything they buy; they want to see things that represent them. However, Generation Z is the opposite when it comes to spending. They buy selectively and strategically and are big savers. These are very sophisticated consumers, with access to a lot more data. This means they are more aware of what exists and what does not.

 For instance, some trends we are seeing include that consumers want their products delivered quickly, which means the supply chain is becoming shorter. Since 2018, we have seen a shift from e-commerce to a-commerce—automated or augmented commerce—which means consumers can use technologies to tell the business about the kind of product they want.

 In the upcoming Union Budget 2020-21 which is due to be presented on February 1, 2020, there is just limited room for income tax rate cut.

 Officials Say There Is Limited Room For Income Tax Cut In Budget 2020

 As per a government official, the government will look at mopping at non-tax revenues in the financial year 2021 and also divestment and asset monetization will be pushed. Further in the year FY21, the governments stake in many of the PSUs will be pared down substantially.

 To encourage capital formation, there will be measures proposed to ease rules concerning DDT and LTCG tax.

 Experts hold the view that a cut in income tax and a higher exemption will leave more money in the hands of the lower and middle class people that will likely spur demand and consumption.

 Nonetheless, few are of the opinion that the step will likely be fruitful to a small degree only and the best option will be for the government to use money with it and fuel investment and hence propel demand.

She is seen on a flight with a few friends as the tunes of ‘Sir Jo Tera Chakraye‘ plays in the background. The actor looks pretty but this is definitely an inspiring video considering how Sara has now gone through an incredible transformation from being fat to fab in a few years.

 Sara captioned here Instagram video as, “Presenting Sara ka Sara Sara 💁🏻‍♀️Let’s make ‘light’ of what it was… Let’s also make it lighter than what it was 🤣😂😅Video and transformation credit: @namratapurohit 🙌🏻👊🏻🦾🦿” (sic)

 The actor gave the credit of her transformation to her trainer Namrata Purohit who is one of the most popular workout trainers for most Bollywood celebrities in the country including Katrina Kaif, Janhvi Kapoor and Malaika Arora.

 Sara has been quite vocal about her weight loss journey and her fight with PCOS. During the release of her debut film Kedarnath in 2017, the actor talked about how she was obsessed with eating pizza while she was staying in New York and was absolutely crazy about her diet. The actor revealed that she took charge of her life after being diagnosed with PCOS and decided to lose weight to overcome her illness and things have been shaping up well for her.

 As the Test series between South Africa and England team has ended, the rankings on the points table of the ICC World Test Championship (WTC) 2019-21 has also witnessed a change. With England winning the Test series by 3-1, they are placed third after India and Australia.

 India is topping with charts with 300 points, whereas Australia claimed 296 points.

 South Africa lost the home series against the visiting side England with the scoreline of 1-3. This defeat is considered a major setback for the Proteas. Also, their six points were deducted because of the slow over-rate against England in the last Test match in Johannesburg. Thus, with 24 points, Faf du Plessis-led side is at No. 7 among the nine countries.

 In seven games, Proteas has lost as many as six matches in the seven Tests played under WTC.

 Joe Root-led side has made massive progress in the WTC which has brought them back in the competition. After facing defeat against New Zealand, England registered the comfortable win over South Africa. Having played nine games in Test Championship, they have won five games and lost three.

 Tim Paine-led team is the second-best in this championship. They are the only team who have played ten games so far and out of which, they have won seven, lost twice with one match ending in a draw.

 On the other hand, the No.1 ranked Test team India has played seven games and won all of them which is the most wins by any side in this format.

 Meanwhile, India will play the next Test series against New Zealand. Team India will play Two-match Test series against the Kiwis scheduled from 21st February.

1873,0,Gujarati,pqr,"Saif Ali Khan must be elated. His latest release, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, in which he played the antagonist, is doing great business at the box office. And now, he’s gearing up for Jawaani Janeman, in which he plays a ‘khula saand’, until he comes to know that he has a grown-up daughter.

 If you’re not living under a rock, you must’ve known about the recreated Ole Ole song in the film. It hasn’t got a great response from the audience. In a conversation with Hindustan Times, when Saif was asked about the song, he said, “Sometimes, you have to do what the production (team) thinks will sell or what the trend is. I feel it’s remarkable that I’ve been working for so long that I could star in the remix of my own song (smiles). In a way that was interesting, but then, I feel Ole Ole was probably best left where it is... It’s a great song for a time that has gone. To reinvent is not something I’d have liked to do, but like I said, you listen to the marketing bosses.” (Also read: #ThereWasNoConceptOf trends on twitter after Saif Ali Khan’s remark triggers off meme fest)

 The actor also spoke about why he values success over being famous. “Fame to me is being well known for various reasons. There’s a kind of fame you have when you come from a wealthy family, but, I feel, being successful is the key. In fact, being famous has been a hindrance for me. I like getting paid and I’d like to be wealthy through my work; being famous has never been important.” (Also read: Sara Ali Khan rejected Jawaani Jaanemans offers reveals Saif Ali Khan)

 He added, “All my life, I’ve had a certain amount of spotlight on me, at least in India. But, I also enjoy the anonymity in London, so there’s a fine balance between people knowing you, and not knowing you in some places. I’m happy either way.”

Ideally, this should have been the opening weekend collections of the Ashwiy Iyer Tiwary directed film. The irony is that this one is actually a good entertainer but due to various reasons (especially the clash with two biggies - Street Dancer 3D and Tanhaji - The Unsung Warrior), the footfalls have been distributed.

 Nonetheless, one now expects the film to find better traction on the digital platform. Such genre of films manage to gain footfalls when premiered for the small screen and considering the fact that Panga has seen appreciation for the content, that should turn out to be the case. However, theatrical business will stay sub optimal.

Astle was to be NZ’s frontline spinner for the series but he has decided to quit red-ball cricket to focus on his white-ball career. Astle had made his Test debut back in 2012 against Sri Lanka but only played five Tests.

 After 2012, he made a comeback in playing XI in home Test against Pakistan in 2016 and played his next game against England in 2018. His next Test appearance came a year later against Bangladesh and he warmed bench on the Sri Lanka tour. Astle’s final Test appearance came against Australia in Sydney recently.

 Astle ends his red-ball career with 334 wickets in 119 first-class matches. He had made his first-class debut for Canterbury back in 2005.

 “Playing Test cricket was always the dream and I’m so honoured to have represented my country and province in the longest form of the game. Red-ball cricket is the pinnacle, but also requires a huge amount of time and effort. As I’ve got to the back end of my career I’ve found it harder to maintain the level of commitment required to be fully invested in this version of the game,” he said.

 His absence for the India Test series confirms a comeback for Ajaz Patel, who wasn’t selected for Australia tour as the second spinner. He was pipped by Will Somerville for a place in the Test squad when the visitors needed a replacement for Trent Boult. Mitchell Santner isn’t a confirmed selection in the Test team.

1878,0,Telugu,pqr,"Mumbai: MTV is a cultural home to the millennial generation, music fans and artists, it believes to entertain, lead, break stereotypes and collaborate with young people through its evocative communication. MTV has always stood out of the crowd with youth relevant shows like Roadies, Splitsvilla, Love School, MTV Unplugged, MTV Rock the Vote, Troll Police, The Anti Social Network and many more.

 MTV Insights Studio presents “Mera Bharat Amazeballs”, an extensive study into the behaviour and mindset of the youth in India. This study draws insights from over 25,000+ youngsters across 400+ towns, continuing to lay out the latest youth trends for over a decade.

 “While doing this study, I realized that if you look at every single parameter the last over 10 years and try and create a 10 year trend, then we might have some interesting anecdotes on it; money equals to happiness was an initial thought but overtime that thought has evolved to money is important, but there is a lot happening which I need to figure out.” said Navin Shenoy, Head of Marketing- Youth, Music and English Entertainment, Viacom18 in an exclusive conversation with Medianews4u.

 Shenoy highlighted the point that how today’s youth are action-oriented and how they prefer being independent and don’t like to depend on anybody. With all these actionable insights they have incorporated in their much loved show Roadies which is coming up with its 17th season Roadies Revolution.

 “With tasks not just being related to strength, but also doing tasks that support a cause and that  could be building a school in a village, it could be environment and planting trees and that those would be the tasks, so in that sense, we will use an old show with a new insight that we bought”, said Shenoy

 Shenoy spoke about how all the MTV shows do extremely well on VOOT and all the shows are always on the Top 5 Show category on Voot. Currently, Bigg Boss being the number one and followed by MTV shows. With VOOT hitting the hundred billion monthly active users last week, it’s nothing but a big achievement for them.

 On the importance of being the catching trends before anyone else Shenoy said, “The fact we believe that we are India’s number one Youth platform, and the only way we will remain the number one youth platform is when we are able to show people that we are catching trends before anybody else. Trends should be seen as valuable by marketers who call us and tell us that we want to do next year’s planning.”

 Shenoy also highlighted the fact that talent seems to be a huge thing for young people and that hip hop seems to have a low entry barrier. In comparison to classical singing or Bollywood playback singing, you need to have a trained voice but for hip hop, if you write really well, you can make an average level of delivery because it’s the poetry that’s making the impact more than your knowledge of vocals in classical music.

 While the data of 2018 is compared to 2016, we asked Shenoy as to what relevance does it hold in 2020? Shenoy said, “Whether things have changed this year, will be commissioning the next round this year, by the second half, we’ll know whether it’s changed. But all our past experience shows us that things don’t change majorly between two years unless you have a dramatically different intervention. The only dramatically different intervention was two years back when telecom rates plummeted, and you pretty much had democratization of content and knowledge and there’s been no such thing, so we are quite confident. In fact, if you look at it these are not necessarily mass trends some of them are leading edge trends, which if you catch in time, then you will know what’s going to happen.”

 About on- ground activities Shenoy discussed that young people are concerned about plastic, and which is why they did a brand activation called ‘Thrash Talk’ as normally people send you trashy comments online. For every trashy comment MTV cleaned up one kg of plastic and in doing that when you tell young people and they realize that this brand is getting behind the causes that we believe in and then affinity for your brand increases much more.

 Mumbai: Flag carrier Air India has kept one of its 423-seater jumbo plane ready in Mumbai for the evacuation of Indian citizens from Wuhan province in China in the wake of Cornovirus outbreak in the East Asian country, an official source said on Tuesday.

 The airline is awaiting necessary approvals from the ministries of External Affairs and Health to operate the special evacuation flight, the source said. The decision follows the government instructions to various ministries to take steps to deal with the issue.

 We have kept a Boeing 747-400 ready in Mumbai to operate an evacuation flight to China whenever we get a go ahead from the government, the source said.

 Some 250 Indians are to be evacuated, the source said, adding, we are awaiting clearances from Ministry of External Affairs and also from Health Ministry. The Health Ministrys nod is required because the operating crew has to fly in a virus outbreak territory.

 At the Cabinet Secretary meeting on Monday, the government decided that steps may be taken to prepare for the possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan.

 Coronavirus is a large family of viruses that causes illnesses ranging from the common cold to acute respiratory syndromes, but the virus in China is a novel strain and not seen before.

 The outbreak has caused alarm because of its similarity to SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome). Accordingly, the Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities while the Ministry of Civil Aviation and Ministry of Health will make arrangements for transport and quarantine facilities respectively, an official release had said on Monday.

 The government also asked the Civil Aviation Ministry to issue instruction to airlines for managing and notifying anybody reporting illness on all direct and indirect flight to China besides facilitating in-flight announcements and distribution of health cards to all flights with direct or indirect connectivity to China.

 Officials said the Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities for evacuation of Indian nationals, mostly students, stuck in Wuhan city.

 It was decided that steps may be taken to prepare for possible evacuation of Indian nationals in Wuhan. Accordingly, Ministry of External Affairs will make a request to the Chinese authorities, a government statement said.

 Wuhan along 12 other cities have been completely sealed by the Chinese authorities to stop the virus from spreading. The death toll climbed to 80 with 2,744 confirmed cases. Over 250 to 300 Indian students are reportedly stuck in Wuhan triggering concerns over their well-being.

Imam’s cousin brother and two others were also taken into custody day before yesterday. Meanwhile,  media reports had earlier said that two teams of police from Uttar Pradeshs Aligarh have been set up to arrest Sharjeel who was one of the organisers of the anti-CAA protest in Delhis Shaheen Bagh.

 Reports had also suggested that diligent efforts are being made to arrest Imam who had made controversial remarks about the cutting off of the northeastern region from India. He, in a video that later surfaced online, could be seen saying, We know how Muslims are being treated in Assam. We have to save people from the NRC. The only way to do it is by cutting northeast from India.

 Sarma, also the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) convenor, told reporters here that Union Home Minister Amit Shah had clearly said on Monday that if the anti-talk ULFA(I) faction is ready for negotiations, then the Centre is more than willing to hold dialogue with them for the sake of permanent peace in Assam and the Northeast.

 A historic Accord was signed on Monday through discussions with all the factions of the NDFB. The Centre and state government want peace in the region through dialogue, Sarma said, referring to the Bodo pact.

 Most of the militant outfits in the northeastern states, barring some in Assam and Manipur, are holding talks but if we want peace in the region, it should be inclusive by involving all the factions and the outfits, he said.

 The offer comes a few days after ULFA(I) claimed responsibility for four serial blasts in Upper Assam districts on the Republic Day.

1885,0,Gujarati,abc,"We are increasingly moving into a VUCA world - Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous. Pervasive and disruptive technology, rapid information flow, globally interconnected supply chains and financial markets are sucking us deeper into the chaos of this fast paced world. There is a need to make sense of the world and understand not just how to fit in, but to lead the rest. This is only possible through executive education.

 With the world’s youngest population, the biggest onus on India is on education and leadership. The education sector must evolve and respond to these changing needs. And time has already run out.

 Although access has increased, quality remains poor -- low employability of graduates, outdated and globally irrelevant curriculum, poor quality of teaching, crumbling infrastructure, non-existent research, etc.

 A recent report by Brookings shows that about 50% of enrolment in higher education is in three degrees BA, BSc, and BComm. Most of these courses are run through colleges affiliated to universities and there is limited scope of innovation.

 This in turn, feeds in to the cycle of ignorance, wherein the education system remains unchanged and outdated.

 We need universities like Takshshila in the modern day to help address issues like outdated education and produce competent leadership.

 The Indian Civilisation is an old and living civilisation that has existed for over 2000 years, and has consistently produced great thought leaders, reformist social leaders, and dedicated political leaders in the past.

 Takshshila is considered one of the greatest education institutes in the history of the world, producing both - thought and leaders.

 The great grammarian and information theorist Panini was also believed to be at Takshashila.

 The commonalities amongst these institutions were that they were steeped in the ethos of the country they were founded in, and placed importance on the development of skills.

 Indic knowledge systems are knowledge frameworks that are authentic to India, and are derived from centuries of wisdom from thought and political leaders.

 These evergreen frameworks, when calibrated in the modern context, will help produce relevant solutions to tackle Indias pressing concerns, including outdated education and leadership crisis.

 Meta-skills are mental models that help with better assimilation of information i.e. the process of learning.

 In an information heavy environment, meta-skills like critical thinking, deductive reasoning, leadership communication, and networking, prove extremely useful in decluttering non-relevant details and help focus on what’s important.

 Here are a few examples what modern leadership schools are like and what they should adapt from the Takshshila model:

 1. Japan’s Takshshila: Matsushita Institute of Government and Management

 2. France’s Takshshila: École Libre des Sciences Politiques (Sciences Po)

 By replicating the Takshshila model and inculcating Indian ethos in our leadership schools, competent leadership can be generated for India that can help tackle India’s pressing concerns.

1889,0,Gujarati,pqr,"United Spirits jumped 9 per cent to Rs 629.70 on the BSE on Tuesday after the company announced robust numbers for the quarter which ended December 2019. On consolidated basis, United Spirits net profit rose 15.3 per cent to Rs 235.30 crore in Q3 FY20 as against net profit of Rs 202.99 in the year-ago quarter. The profit was led largely by a sharp growth in sales (8 per cent) of Prestige and Above portfolio.

 Profit before tax (PBT) for Q3FY20 stood at Rs 314 crore, up by 8.2 per cent against Rs 290.30 crore in the year-ago quarter. Tax expenses declined 26.2 per cent to Rs 94.90 crore from Rs 128.60 crore in Q3FY19.

 The companys reported EBITDA for the quarter was Rs 424 crore, up 18 per cent YoY. Despite significant gross margin compression, EBITDA margin came in at 16.4 per cent, up 207 bps, primarily delivered through savings in operating costs and to a lesser extent by a lower marketing reinvestment rate. Interest costs were Rs 46 crore, 21 per cent lower than in the corresponding quarter last year.

 We are particularly encouraged to see some momentum in our Prestige and Above portfolio, a sharp improvement from the previous quarter, when the segment hadn’t grown, in part due to our internal operational challenges. Additionally, during the quarter, we saw a return of premiumisation trend, with each sub-segment growing faster than the one beneath it, said Anand Kripalu, CEO, United Spirits.

 We are optimistic that the economy will gradually recover, and with that the business should bounce back more strongly. We remain committed to our medium-term ambition of growing the top line by double digits and to improve EBITDA margin to mid-high teens” he said.

 Anand finished joints sixth alongside Anish Giri of Holland, Jeffery Xiong of United States, Duda, Artemiev and Firouzja.

 In the challengers section, things worked out well for the Indian duo of Surya Shekhar Ganguly and Nihal Sarin as they both won their games for a good finish. Sarin defeated Rauf Mamedov of Azerbaijan in what was a clinical display while Ganguly crashed through the defences of Anton Smirnov of Australia.

Of course, the nature of the pitch was a bit different from the first match when upwards of 400 runs were scored, as the ball gripped the surface more. Hamilton could offer some assistance to bowlers and the average first innings score at this venue is 177 and that could give way to some high-intensity match. India might not tinker too much with the line-up especially with the series within the grasp and the existing XI has done a good job as they will be looking for another cohesive effort on the morrow.

 It was not that the Kiwis were awful in the series thus far but Indians just had all the answers to the questions they were posed. Their batsmen must find way to score against Jasprit Bumrah in particular to get a move on. The NZ bowlers looked to exert pressure on India in pockets and they need to sustain it for a longer period to get the desired result.

 James Rodriguez is wanted by both Arsenal and Everton.

 Bengaluru, January 28: Arsenal are reportedly set to compete with Everton for a loan deal of James Rodriguez.

 Real Madrid are reportedly keen to offload the 28-year-old Colombian attacking midfielder and are open to either a loan deal or a permanent one.

 It is presumed that the Los Blancos are willing to accept a fee around £34m for the player, but both Arsenal and Everton are more interested in a loan deal.

 Everton boss Carlo Ancelotti shares an excellent relationship with the Colombian whom he managed both at Real Madrid and Bayern Munich. In fact, he was the one who signed him at both clubs and was also close to reuniting with the 28-year-old at Napoli last summer.

 Arsenal, now managed by Mikel Arteta, are desperately short of quality and depth in almost every department. Mesut Ozil has managed to get back into the starting XI since the appointment of Arteta, but the Gunners could still do with more creativity in their side. And, Rodriguez is someone who could provide them exactly that. Things have not worked well for the Colombian in the last few years at Real Madrid and Bayern but his quality remains undisputed.

 Under Arteta, Arsenal have improved in terms of creating chances by leaps and bounds but have been let down by their shambolic defence. For the kind of free-flowing football Arteta is planning to play with the Gunners, a fit and confident Rodriguez could prove to be a welcome addition.

1895,0,Telugu,abc,"UFC Fight Night on ESPN: Ngannou vs. Rozenstruik will be headlined by a heavyweight clash between No. 2 ranked Francis Ngannou and undefeated No. 5 Jairzinho Rozenstruik.

 A former heavyweight title challenger, Ngannou (14-3, fighting out of Paris, France by way of Batie, Cameroon) has delivered some of the most spectacular knockouts in the divisions history.

 Over the course of his career, he has earned stoppage victories over Junior Dos Santos, Cain Velasquez, Alistair Overeem and Curtis Blaydes (twice). Ngannou now looks to be the first fighter to defeat Rozenstruik and re-assert himself as the top contender for a heavyweight title shot.

 The breakout UFC star of 2019, Rozenstruik (10-0, fighting out of Paramaribo, Suriname) wasted no time cracking the heavyweight divisions top five.

 Since debuting on the roster last February, he has delivered four consecutive knockout victories-including a dramatic comeback win against Overeem with four seconds left on the clock. Rozenstruik now hopes to secure his first title shot with another show-stealing knockout against one of the divisions most feared strikers.

 In an exciting clash of top bantamweights, No. 5 ranked contender Raphael Assuncao faces former champion and current No. 9 Cody Garbrandt.

 A perennial bantamweight contender, Assuncao (27-7, fighting out of Alpharetta, Ga. by way of Recife, Brazil) has bested many of the top 135-pound fighters in the UFC.

 Throughout his career, the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt has netted victories against TJ Dillashaw, Aljamain Sterling, Pedro Munhoz and Rob Font. With Garbrandt in his sights, Assuncao now looks to regain momentum by going behind enemy lines and taking out another former UFC champion.

 A native of Uhrichsville, Ohio, Garbrandt (11-3, fighting out of Sacramento, Calif.) aims to begin his ascent back to the top of the 135-pound division with a highlight-reel win in his home state. Known for his spectacular knockout power, he has finished the likes of Takeya Mizugaki and Thomas Almeida.

 In 2016, he became the first fighter to defeat former champion Dominick Cruz in almost a decade. Garbrandt now aims to get back on the winning track and re-stake his claim as one of the top bantamweights in the world.

 Announced bouts on the card include:

 • In a pivotal clash of bantamweight contenders, No. 3 ranked Aspen Ladd (9-1, fighting out of El Dorado Hills, Calif.) meets No. 4 Julianna Peña (10-3, fighting out of Chicago, Ill.)

 • Hard hitting heavyweights collide when Greg Hardy (6-2 1NC, fighting out of Coconut Creek, Fla.) squares off with Yorgan De Castro (5-0, fighting out of Fall River, Mass. by way of Mindelo, Sao Vicente, Cape Verde)

 Arsenal lost Shkodran Mustafi to injury in the 2-1 FA Cup win over Bournemouth, during which several young players impressed Mikel Arteta.

 London, January 28: Mikel Arteta was proud of his young Gunners after Arsenal secured an FA Cup fifth-round spot with a win over Bournemouth.

 The visitors, 13-time winners of the competition, secured a 2-1 triumph at the Vitality Stadium with Bukayo Saka and Eddie Nketiah on target before substitute Sam Surridge grabbed a late consolation in an otherwise one-sided tie.

 Arsenals two goalscorers were the standout performers in a youthful line-up on a night when Artetas defensive options were further depleted by a serious-looking injury for Shkodran Mustafi.

 Bournemouth 1-2 Arsenal: Gunners set up Portsmouth 5th round FA Cup clash

 Arteta, while pleased with Mondays display, admitted the club would need to dip into the transfer market to bolster his squad, with a fifth-round trip to Portsmouth added to their schedule.

 Very pleased. Its always tough to come here and win, weve done it with a young team as well, the Gunners boss told BBC Sport.

 I have a lot of faith in them. I think they are developing really well. They are willing and hungry and will only get better.

 We analyse opponents and try to generate situations that are favourable for our players.

 I was worried with their history in the last few weeks we would concede in the last few minutes.

 Our history with this cup is massive for the club. We need to take it step by step.

 On the injury to Mustafi and his hopes to bring in reinforcements, Arteta added: We will have to assess him but when Mustafi has to come off, normally it is not good.

 We are in the market. We are looking for some things with the resources we have and we will tell you when we have more news.

 Opposite number Eddie Howe conceded his side lost the tactical battle and did not work hard enough without the ball to match their visitors.

 There were tactical problems for us, said the Cherries manager. We changed system a couple of times but we werent ourselves out of possession.

 We were second in the battles. Against quality teams that is what you have to master.

1898,0,English,abc,"Lakers legend Bryant, 41, and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna were killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday, along with seven others in Calabasas, California.

 Sunday and Mondays games have gone ahead as tributes continue to pour in for the five-time champion and 2008 MVP, who spent his entire 20-year career with the Lakers.

 However, Tuesdays blockbuster clash at Staples Center will be rescheduled at a later date, with Los Angeles reeling following Bryants sudden death.

 The decision was made out of respect for the Lakers organisation, which is deeply grieving the tragic loss of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other people in a helicopter crash on Sunday, the NBA said in a statement.

 Bryant, who entered the league with the Lakers in 1996, is regarded as one of the all-time greats following a career spanning two decades at Staples Center.

 An 18-time All-Star and two-time Finals MVP, Bryant won a pair of Olympic gold medals, helping United States to glory in 2008 and 2012.

1899,0,Telugu,pqr,"Du Plessis appeared to bump into Buttler while exchanging words with Broad on the fourth afternoon of the fourth Test, which England won by 191 runs.

 The incident happened as Du Plessis and Rassie van der Dussen were frustrating England during a 92-run partnership on a hot afternoon. The England players seemed to be getting annoyed at Du Plessis habit of picking up the ball after playing a defensive shot.

 After a throw from Sam Curran hit his pads, there were some heated words and Du Plessis appeared to walk into Buttler. Thats part of my character, said Du Plessis on Monday.

 If you go back youll find Im always involved in a little bit of something in a game, trying to show that fight as a leader of the team to show you dont stand back to opposition.

 Its not like Im looking for it but if it comes across my way I wont back down. So that was just him (Broad) saying something to me and me saying something back. I dont think either Jos or myself knew we touched each other, said Du Plessis, who is under pressure after a poor run of form.

 It was just myself and Broady having a go at each other at that stage and it was him trying to get between me and him. There was no malicious intent. England captain Joe Root said he thought the incident was absolute nothing and that at the time he was worried that it would make Du Plessis more determined.

 I thought Faf was using it to get himself going and my worry was that it was going to work in his favour, he said. It was absolute handbags.

 A miserable series for Du Plessis was completed after the close of play on Monday when South Africa were fined 60 percent of their match fee and deducted six World Test Championship points.

 Next up for American 14th seed Kenin is world number one Ash Barty, who defeated last years Australian Open runner-up Petra Kvitova.

 Both unheralded women were featuring in their first grand slam quarter-final after dazzling at Melbourne Park.

 Kenin upstaged 15-year-old sensation and fellow American Coco Gauff in the fourth round, while Jabeur became the first Arab woman through to the quarters of a major after beating giant-slaying seed Wang Qiang.

 The first set saw contrasting approaches – the variety on Jabeurs racquet resulting in 18 unforced errors and 17 winners compared to Kenins five unforced errors and eight winners.

 Kenin and Jabeur both had break point chances, but a break of serve in the seventh game saw the former move ahead 4-3 and it was a lead that she never relinquished.

 Jabeur saved five set points, however, Kenin – who had won the previous two meetings between the pair – eventually closed it out after 44 minutes thanks to another unforced error from her opponent.

 Kenin took control after a tricky start to the second set, Jabeur unable to maintain her fierce performance on centre court.

 Just like the first set, Kenin – yet to face a seed in Melbourne – broke in the seventh game and never looked back en route to the final four.

 lekhaka-Sudip banerjee

 Kolkata, January 28: Chelsea have been offered the chance to sign Spurs target Krzysztof Piatek if reports in Italy are to be believed.

 The Pole has become out of favour at AC Milan and has been linked with several clubs across Europe and in England as well.

 Spurs have been among the biggest suitors of the 24-year-old but Chelsea could potentially hijack their target.

 Spurs have lost their talisman Harry Kane to an injury that could keep him out for the rest of the season. And, Jose Mourinho is desperate to sign a new striker in January who could fill in for the England international. They even made a loan offer for the Polish international with an option to buy in the summer. However, it is believed that Milan are only interested in a permanent deal or a loan deal which includes an obligation to buy.

 Chelsea could capitalize on Spurs hesitation to sign Piatek and ideally it would be a better move for the striker himself. If he moves to Spurs, he could potentially become their first-choice striker for the remainder of the season but things will change when Kane returns from injury.

 On the other hand, Piatek might join Chelsea as a back-up of Tammy Abraham, but it is yet to be seen if the 22-year-old Englishman manages to maintain his form or not. Replacing Abraham is any day a less difficult job than to replace someone like Kane.

 Piatek has certainly struggled this season, but hardly any Milan player has been able to impress. The Rossoneri have endured yet another difficult campaign and it would be not fair to single out an individual player for that.

 Milan reportedly want £25m for the services of Piatek and Chelsea are in a much better position compared to Spurs to take a shot with the striker.

 The right-handed opener has an average of 29.83 in the IPL while his highest score is 91*. Although these numbers are up to the mark, the Englishman is unlikely to feature in the playing XI of his franchise.

 West Indian fast bowling all-rounder, Keemo Paul was retained by the Delhi Capitals ahead of the auction. He played his first IPL season in 2019 and; he had a decent outing for the Delhi-based franchise as the right-arm pacer scalped 9 wickets in 8 matches. Also, he scored 18 runs and took 5 catches on the field. His strike rate of 18.11 reflects his wicket-taking ability but the Caribbean player’s economy rate of 8.72 may keep him away from the playing XI. Delhi Capitals have the trio of Chris Woakes, Kagiso Rabada, and Ishant Sharma in their pace bowling attack. Former IPL Purple Cap winner, Mohit Sharma is also present in the squad.Besides, Delhis two all-rounders Marcus Stoinis and Harshal Patel possess the same talent as Paul. Looking at the recent form of Stoinis and Patel, it seems like Delhi would ignore the West Indian’s services in IPL 2020. He could have been a match-winner for other IPL franchises but Paul will prove surplus for the Capitals.

 Kobe Bryants 13-year-old daughter Gianna, who died alongside her father in the helicopter crash that claimed the life of the NBA legend, had shown signs that she could further her fathers glittering basketball legacy.

 Bryants eldest daughter, 17-year-old Natalia, prefers volleyball, Bianka is only three and Capri was only born last year.

 So the 41-year-old NBA greats basketball hopes were invested in Gianna.

 The best thing that happens is when we go out and fans would come up to me and shell be standing next to me... and theyll be like, Youve gotta have a boy, you and V. gotta have a boy.

 You gotta have somebody to carry on your tradition, the legacy. She (Gianna) is like, I got this. Im like, thats right, he went on. Yes, you do, you got this.

 She often worked out with her father in the gymnasium of the familys villa in Newport Beach and he took pride in coaching her high school team when his schedule permitted.

 Gianna was on the helicopter that crashed because she was travelling to a tournament in the Los Angeles suburbs to play for her team, called the Mamba Team, after one of her fathers nicknames.

 One of her teammates was also on board the helicopter and was also among the dead.

 And of course, she had introductions that other young girls players could only dream of - her fathers former agent Rob Pelinka introduced her to basketball stars and coaches.

 Derek Fisher, a Lakers teammate of her father and now coach of the WNBA Sparks, had noticed that Kobes steely will to win had rubbed off on Gianna.

 They have the similar demeanor and personality, Fisher said.

There was nothing new from the two-hour-long success meet. However, one interesting point is that Allu Arjun has revealed that after watching the film in the theatre he’d realized that it was purely Trivikram’s magic, nothing else.

 When asked about what efforts he’d put in for giving a career-best performance, he said that he didn’t aware that he was giving such a best act. “Trivikram did the trick. He extracted the best from me, without me realizing it. That is his magic,” he attributed the best. But Trivikram was quick to add that it was Allu Arjun who had shown consistency in his expressions. “It was purely the actor’s magic. He internalized the character. We shot the interval sequence in the second schedule and Bunny’s performance during this episode was the reference point for his actions throughout. I give credit to him,” Trivikram praised Bunny.

 The entire press meet was like each other passing praises to one another as the film went on to become such a MASSIVE hit. So, they are enjoying the moment.

 While addressing a rally in Mangaluru, Rajnath Singh said: “NRC par main kehna chahata hoon. Kya kisi desh ko yeh nahi pata hona chahiye ki desh mein kitne swadeshi hain, kitne videshi hain? NRC agar aa bhi jata hai toh kya pareshani hain?(On NRC, I want to say, shouldn’t every nation know how many citizens and foreigners live on its soil? What is the problem if NRC is implemented?).

 Defending the BJP led government, he said that it is not our government that initiated the NRC. “NRC naam ki chidiya hum log lekar nahi aaye thhe…. NRC naam ki chidiya Supreme Court ke aadesh par iske pehle Congress ne..,” (we did not bring NRC. It was brought by the Congress government at the orders of the Supreme Court), he said, adding that now the blame of this NRC is being laid on BJP.

 His remarks come weeks after Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a rally said that there has been no discussion on NRC yet. Modi made the statement in December 2019 in Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan. “See if anything has happened on NRC, the opposition is spreading lies. From the time BJP government came in 2014 till today, there was no discussion on NRC,” the PM had said.

 The defence minister Rajnath Singh also clarified on the recently Citizenship Amendment Act saying that the government came up with CAA to safeguard minorities in the adjoining regions. “Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are not secular states. Three of them are theocratic states. Islam is the religion of these three states. India’s religion is not Hinduism but a secular nation. That is the reason those who follow Islam cannot be persecuted in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan,” Singh added.

 Singh also stated that the Muslims from these three countries can get citizenship through due process.

 Several protests have erupted in various parts of India over the CAA and NRC.

1923,0,Hindi,pqr,"Hamilton (New Zealand), Jan 28 (PTI) No one sits on the seat that Mahendra Singh Dhoni made his own in the team bus, revealed India leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal, saying that the talismanic former skipper is missed by the side.

 In a video shot inside the team bus while it was on its way to Hamilton for the third T20 International against New Zealand, Chahal is seen talking to several members of the squad including Jasprit Bumrah, Rishabh Pant and KL Rahul.

 Towards the end of the video, he moved to the rear of the bus and pointed to an empty seat which, he said, was the former captains preferred spot before he went on a sabbatical last year.

 Yeh woh seat hai jahan ek legend baithate the. Mahi bhai. Abhi bhi yaha koi nahi baithata. Hum unhe bohot miss karte hai (This is the seat that used to be occupied a legend. MS Dhoni. No one sits here now. We miss him a lot), Chahal said in the video posted on bcci.tv.

 The-38-year-old Dhoni has not played a competitive game since the World Cup semifinal loss to New Zealand on July 9. Earlier this month, Dhoni was dropped from the BCCIs list of centrally contracted players, raising fresh doubts on his future.

 However, on the same day Dhoni returned to training, batting fluently in the Jharkhand team nets.

 Head coach Ravi Shastri has hinted that the celebrated wicketkeeper-batsman might retire from ODIs soon but will be in contention for a T20 World Cup berth provided he does well for Chennai Super Kings in the IPL.

 The Indian team lead the five-match T20 series against New Zealand 2-0.

 Virat Kohlis men will take on the hosts in the third T20 here on Wednesday.

1928,0,Hindi,abc,"Hamilton, Jan 28 (PTI) A ruthless India are expected to seal their maiden T20 International series win in New Zealand and only a special comeback from the struggling hosts in the third game here on Wednesday can delay what seems inevitable.

 India won the twin T20 Internationals in Auckland by margins of six and seven wickets respectively to go 2-0 up in the five-match series.

 A third successive win at Seddon Park will give them their first ever T20I series win on New Zealand soil, a feat they were unable to achieve on two occasions previously. India lost 0-2 under Mahendra Singh Dhoni back in 2008-09, and last year, they went down 1-2.

 Overall, this Indian side has seen an uptick in fortunes and are unbeaten in five T20 series since the 2019 ODI World Cup, including the ongoing one against the Black Caps. The only contest they didnt win was against South Africa, when the three-match series ended 1-1 after one of the games was washed out.

 However, their current winning form in T20 cricket wont lead to any meaningful change in the ICC rankings. India are currently placed fifth in the T20I rankings, and need to win the remaining three matches – this series 5-0 – to move up to fourth from their current fifth spot.

 New Zealand are currently placed sixth. Pakistan, Australia, England and South Africa, in that order, sit ahead in the rankings table.

 The greater concern at present is building towards the T20 World Cup to be hosted in Australia later this year. In that regard though, the team management is quietly confident that various pieces of the jigsaw puzzle are starting to fall into place, and at the right time.

 This is specifically boosted by the performances of KL Rahul and Shreyas Iyer over the recent months, particularly on tour thus far.

 As such, there are no changes to be expected in the Indian line-up for the third T20. On Tuesday, there was an optional practice session with skipper Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah, the ones missing in action.

 The support staff worked closely with those players who havent yet received a chance to play in the series yet. Ravi Shastri paid close attention to Washington Sundar, while batting coach Vikram Rathour was busy with Rishabh Pant. Both are expected to sit out again on Wednesday.

 There is possibility of one change to the Indian line-up. Kuldeep Yadav sat out the first two matches in Auckland, and that could have been a move motivated more by the ground size than anything else.

 Chahal provides greater control and his wrist spin moves away from the majority of right-handers in the Black Caps line-up, thus against the arc of swing.

 Yadav is a tad more adventurous in his flight and the angle of his spin into the right-handers could have been easy fodder at Eden Parks short boundaries.

 Whether Yadav comes back into contention at the regular-sized Seddon Park remains to be seen. Additionally, there is little chance of Chahal-Yadav playing together, a move India have shied away from since the ODI World Cup.

 From New Zealands perspective, this is the last opportunity for Colin de Grandhomme to make an impression. The all-rounder will be replaced in the squad for the last two T20Is by batsman Tom Bruce.

 Grandhomme has played strictly as a batsman so far in this series, and has scores of 0 and 3 in the first two games.

 New Zealand are not too worried about their bowling performances in this series, despite Indias relative ease in chasing down totals in the first two matches. Their greater worry is contending with the Indian bowling, in particular Jasprit Bumrah who has regained much of his pre-injury rhythm.

 In both matches, they were unable to get him away, whether at the start or during the death overs. For their part, India mixed things up well in the second T20, holding Bumrah back until later in the power play.

 New Zealand have had a poor run at Eden Park off late, but their record at Seddon Park holds in good stead. They have won seven out of nine T20Is played here, and will be hoping to stop India from taking an unassailable lead in the series.

 Teams (from):

 India: Virat Kohli (capt), Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul (wk), Manish Pandey, Rishabh Pant, Sanju Samson, Shreyas Iyer, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah, Shardul Thakur, Navdeep Saini, Washington Sundar.

 New Zealand: Kane Williamson (capt), Martin Guptill, Ross Taylor, Scott Kuggeleijn, Colin Munro, Colin de Grandhomme, Tom Bruce, Daryl Mitchell, Mitchell Santner, Tim Seifert (wk), Hamish Bennett, Ish Sodhi, Tim Southee, Blair Tickner.

 Match starts at: 12.30pm IST.

1929,0,Hindi,xyz,"HMD Global is planning to scrap the release of Nokia 9.1 PureView this year and is currently focusing on the next-generation Nokia 9.2 PureView, stated a report. The newer flagship will be powered by Qualcomms Snapdragon 865, while the 9.1 version was supposed to come with the older Snapdragon 855 processor. This processor is also expected to make an appearance on the Galaxy S20 Ultra and OnePlus 8 Pro, so the competition is going to be tough for Nokia.

 Although specifics were not released yet, the report claims that the Finnish company was dropping the Nokia 9.1 because of the dim response the Nokia 9 PureView received after being launched. The report further added that it had heard from a source that by launching the Nokia 9.2 PureView, HMD Global will be able to launch the flagship in the first half of 2020 just like other manufacturers.

 The report also claimed that the Nokia 9.2 would not feature the ‘light camera technology’ but still come with a ‘great camera’ and a big sensor. To usher in greater sales, HMD might adopt a Nokia 8-like feature/pricing balance. According to a report, the next flagship could debut before June this year. The details of the pricing haven’t been provided yet but HMD would like to avoid competing with premium flagships directly.

1930,0,English,pqr,"Motorola has finally started to roll out the Android 10 update for the Moto G7 Plus in Brazil and Mexico. According to reports, the stable update will take a few weeks time to hit other markets, including the United States and India. This update will be the final version as its beta version was launched last week in the company’s traditional manner for the phased roll-out of software updates. The update will come with the latest security patches and features like full gesture navigation, dark theme, better privacy controls, among others.

 The reason for launching the update in Brazil before anywhere else can be cited to its popularity in the country. According to the company’s Brazilian support page, the update started rolling out a few days ago. Moto G7 Plus became the third Motorola smartphone to get Android 10, after the Motorola One Power and Motorola One Vision. However, both of these phones were a part of the Android One programme, which is not the case with Moto G7 Plus. Interestingly, its successor, Moto G8 Plus, also hasnt received the software update as of yet.

 The pace of releasing the update can be also seen as unsatisfactory as it comes after five months of Android 10’s release. With a 6.2 inch display, Moto G7 Plus features a Snapdragon 636 processor, a 16-megapixel rear camera and 12-megapixel front camera. It has 3,000mAh battery and a memory card slot in addition to its 64GB internal storage.

 In his next film, Jawaani Jaaneman, Saif plays a womanising man in his 40s, who suddenly comes face to face with a teenage daughter he never knew he had. “I may not have been responsible at various times while in my 20s, but I’ve always been there and ready to do the best that I can do at that time for my kids. I have never felt like an absentee father,” Saif told Mumbai Mirror in an interview.

 Asked about the difference between raising Sara and Ibrahim, and his youngest son Taimur, Saif said, “The difference, I suppose, is that I’m a little more patient now, whereas when Sara and Ibrahim were young, I was trying to build my career.” He added, “Since I didn’t really know what I wanted, I was a bit more selfish when it came to giving them more time.”

 He continued, “I’m still a bit selfish with my time, but I’m more patient than I was.” While Sara and Ibrahim were born to his ex-wife Amrita Singh, Taimur was born in 2016, to Saif’s wife, actor Kareena Kapoor Khan.

 Saif spoke about his divorce in an interview to Pinkvilla and called it ‘the worst thing in the world’. He said, “That is something I still feel could have been different. I think I will never really be okay with that... I try my best to make peace with that and with myself saying that I was 20 and I was quite young and so much changes... You feel bad but it is a strange thing...”

 Saif most recently appeared in the period epic, Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior, which has become his biggest hit. The film has made close to Rs 230 crore in India, and is expected to hit the Rs 250 crore mark soon. Saif confirmed that he is currently working on four films, officially -- Bunty Aur Babli 2, with Rani Mukerji; Lafdebaaz with Farhan Akhtar; a remake of Vikram Vedha with Aamir Khan; and his passion project Bhoot Police.

 Ajay will portray the role of Syed Abdul Rahim, who served as coach and manager of Indian football team from 1950 until his death in 1963. He shared the poster on Twitter with the caption, “#MaidaanTeaser - Get ready for Maidaan! 27th November 2020.”

 Many fans of the actor asked him to release the film around Christmas. A fan wrote, “Please make it Xmas”. Another wrote, “Sir xmas par aao full support.” One more fan wrote, “Kabhi toh Festival par Release karo Ajay sir.” Meanwhile, Christmas is reserved for Aamir Khan’s Laal Singh Chaddha this year.

 Maidaan is being directed by Amit Ravindernath Sharma of Badhaai Ho fame and produced by Zee Studios, Boney Kapoor, Akash Chawla and Arunava Joy Sengupta. Talking about the film, Ajay had told PTI in an interview, “It is a fabulous story, director Amit Sharma has done a great job. Times have changed, storytelling has changed. There are no deliberate commercial elements added to a film today, be it a song or the romantic angle. Maidaan has been very moving and emotional journey for me.”

 South star Keerthy Suresh was expected to make her Bollywood debut with Maidaan. She was, however, replaced by National Award-winning actor Priyamani as the former looked “too young” for the role. A statement from the makers read, “Keerthy shot for the film for a day. After the shoot, the makers and Keerthy both felt that she looked too young as she had lost a lot of weight since being signed for the film to authentically portray the role of a mother as has been written in the script.”

 All my adult life, I have been asked this question. It inevitably makes me feel apologetic or guilty, because I know the answer should be a resounding musical yes. It should be an answer that contains all the amazing knowledge that was carefully handed to me like pearls and rubies – the secret two-note taan, the rare compositions; that voice training that can send notes soaring high above the skyline.

 My musical journey started when a mother extricated a reluctant ten year old from her comfort zone and sent her to the reclusive and remarkable Dhondutai. She was the only student of the formidable Kesarbai, whose voice and manners could merge robust masculine with seductive feminine energies to create music that has rarely been heard before or after. Dhondutai was not that. But she was an extraordinarily gentle and patient teacher who tolerated the fidgety brat that sat in front of her three days a week for only one reason: she saw in me the qualities that she felt, if nurtured, would carry forth the Jaipur gharana legacy.

 “To be a true musician, you have to be amir or fakir,” she often said. Because, in either case, you have freedom. Through her, I started finding musical metaphors in everything around – the whirring drone of the fan; the recurrent cry of a street vendor; in festivals, in colour, in the scent of sandalwood that snaked out of her dollshouse of gods and goddesses.

 Even when she made tea, she would combine two different strains in a very particular ratio, and compare them to the compound combination ragas, a specialty of the Jaipur gharana. “Like the tea, they should come together so seamlessly, that you should not be able to tell when one raga finishes and the other starts…” she said.

 And so, I grew up at the feet of my third grandmother in this alternate plane where music became breath. I learned Raga Bhoop for more than two years and only when the foundation was unshakable, I was guided further down the road – to the light and lilting Tilak Kamod, the sombre morning notes of Lalit, a plaintive composition in Jaijaiwanti, a majestic Basanti Kedar, and so many more. Some I stayed with; some were only to be able to accompany my teacher in a concert, where I learned how to fill the notes in between and to sustain holding a tanpura without allowing my foot to fall asleep. Indian music is about so much more than music. It is about patience and humility and an understanding that there can be something so immense that one life is scarcely enough.

 I went away to college in America. Although I had a degree from Princeton, I came back to Borivli, to Dhondutai. Like a migratory crane that follows its own bird wisdom. I wanted to become a professional singer. I spent a year in serious training, ignoring the muffled sniggers of friends and my baffled but indulgent parents. I got up early in the morning to train my voice, building each note as gradually as the rising sun. I started paying close attention to the nuances that come when a singer matures, modulating voice and tone, enabling expression and pause.

 But I started faltering. I could not keep up the rigour that this art form requires of its practitioners. One night of partying would reflect in my voice. My friends had jobs and boyfriends. I started realising that I did not have the guts to pursue a seemingly pointless passion in a world where success is measured in terms of how much money you make and how well you are known. I was too scared to carry on. So, I continued to go visit my beloved teacher, but I fell into my second love – writing. I stopped singing.

 A few years ago, I was at the National Centre for the Performing Arts in South Bombay to visit my old friend Suvarnalata Rao. Gleaming musical instruments lined the wall like ancestral portraits. She asked me that dreaded question:

 Do you still sing?

 I replied, “Not really… well, yes, some times, but only for myself.”

 “Why do you say it like that? Do you think singing for oneself is any lesser than singing for an audience? In fact, if you think about it, it gives you much more freedom!”

 I stared at her in wonder. Suddenly, something started lifting, a weight that prevented me from engaging with a space that had once been like breathing. I realised that we have come to define everything in a performative sense, needing external validation, almost becoming a selfie version of ourselves –  the opposite of the inner world you enter when you start a Bhairavi or make that quiet cup of tea.

 I now sing. Not often. Not very well. Not to prove anything, or carry on any legacy. But with joy. Like bird song. Like the devotee who hums prayers alone in a temple. Like breath.

 This first appeared in ON Stage, the official monthly magazine of the National Centre for the Performing Arts, Mumbai.

1939,0,Telugu,xyz,"The Centre is looking to hire a professional communications agency to bring about a behavioural change in the mindset of people about Census 2021 and updation of National Population Register (NPR) so that they provide accurate information to enumerators, The Economic Times reported.

 The Registrar General of India (RGI) has floated a bid document on January 21, the report stated.

 The aim behind conducting the exercise is to reach out to the masses at a time when many opposition-ruled states have said that they will not roll out the NPR or enforce the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

 Moneycontrol couldn’t independently verify the report.

 The NPR -- a biometric database of ordinary residents of India – has seen wide protests across the nation. Critics feel the CAA will be used in conjunction with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) that may follow the NPR to discriminate against Muslims. The government has denied this allegation.

 As per the bid document, the key focus of the agency will be to “create and design awareness and publicity material about Census 2021-NPR and its activities, goals and objectives” so that it effectively delivers the messages on various aspects of census and NPR “to all target audience and stakeholders.”

 For the proposed project, the government reportedly plans to hire reputed advertising agencies and use all campaign modes such as mass media, digital and social media as well as street plays and puppet shows to drive home the message.

 The report said the campaign will run in English, Hindi and 16 regional languages on television, radio, billboards and text messages on phone.

 The agency will also produce video and audio spots, and documentaries on census-NPR themes for a “360-degree media campaign”, the report said, adding that five celebrities will be selected for the endorsement.

 This awareness campaign is going to be the first such exercise on such a broad scale that the government will conduct ahead of the count, the report added.

If the passenger is uncomfortable being recorded, he/she has the option of switching off the camera.

1943,0,Gujarati,abc,"Budget 2020 Expectations for Standard Deduction: Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will present her second Union Budget on February 1, 2020. After the government slashed corporate tax rates a few month ago, individual taxpayers’ hopes for a similar relief in the form of higher tax slab limits or reduction in tax rates are quite fair. While the government may have limited room to reduce the personal tax rates due to the challenge on the fiscal deficit side, it may resort to provide other tax reliefs to ease the tax burden on the middle-class salaried taxpayers.

 Although the government in the past budgets has given certain reliefs to the salaried class taxpayers in terms of no tax up to income of Rs 5 lakh, introduction of standard deduction etc., however, overall these deductions or reliefs available to them are not adequate which eventually results into higher tax withholding and lower take home salary every month.

 The salaried class bears the brunt of taxes on account of unaligned tax rules for different taxpayers. Since there aren’t many significant exemptions or deductions available to them (except HRA, LTA, etc. to name a few), there is an expectation that the government should raise the limit of standard deduction substantially. What is this standard deduction?

 The Finance Act, 2018 introduced a standard deduction from salary income to the extent of Rs 40,000. However, in lieu of such a deduction, the exemption for transport allowance of Rs 19,200 per annum and medical expenses reimbursement of Rs 15,000 per annum were withdrawn. Effectively, the incremental relief was just Rs 5,800 per annum.

 Subsequently, this limit for standard deduction was raised from Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000 for the financial year (FY) 2019-20. On the positive side, the employees get flat deduction without the hassle of furnishing supporting documents or bills. However, the limit not only fails to keep up with the actual expenditure which an individual incurs now a days on medical, travel, etc., but also it is inadequate when compared to benefits available to a business class taxpayer. A business class /professional individual taxpayer having its own independent business or profession, enjoys the benefit of claiming deduction for all the actual expenses incurred i.e. travel, printing and stationery, books and periodicals staff salary, vehicle running and maintenance expenses being incurred for carrying out business activities /exercising profession.

 Watch: What is Union Budget of India?

 It is important to note that the key purpose of the standard deduction is to put salaried class individuals at par with individuals earning professional income with respect to providing deduction of expenses incurred for earning income. Hence, it is only fair for the government to increase this limit of standard deduction from the existing Rs 50,000 to cover all the expenses of a salaried individual.

 Another issue is that the limit for standard deduction is the same irrespective of the salary range of an individual. For example, the employees drawing salary of Rs 5 crore per annum as well Rs 5 lakh per annum are eligible for the same standard deduction of Rs 50,000. Is this justifiable?

 Here, it is important to discuss that the concept of standard deduction is not new. In fact, till FY 2004-05, such deduction was based on the percentage of salary drawn by an employee. For individuals who were earning salary income up to Rs 5 lakh, the standard deduction was allowed to the extent of 40% of the salary or Rs 30,000, whichever is less. For salary income exceeding Rs 5 lakh, a deduction of Rs 20,000 was allowable. Later, this provision was deleted in view of the broadening of income slabs proposed in the Finance Bill 2005.

 Considering this, it is equally fair for the Finance Minister to consider increasing the standard deduction limit up to Rs 1,00,000 for individuals having salary income up to Rs 10,00,000. For salary income exceeding Rs 10,00,000, deduction could be based on percentage of salary, subject to a maximum cap.

 The government has addressed the supply-side constraints by slashing the base corporate tax rates to 22% (for existing companies) and 15% (for new manufacturing companies incorporated after 1 October 2019), resulting into effective tax rates of 25.17% and 17.16%, respectively. However, they should now focus on demand side constraints and provide impetus to the economy by giving a boost to the consumption.

 With the super-rich tax introduced last year, the effective tax rates for non-corporate taxpayers earning taxable income above Rs 2 crore and Rs 5 crore went up to 39% and 42.74%, respectively. The standard deduction limit may be made more progressive, which could vary with salary levels, thereby giving benefit to the salaried class taxpayers at par with other individual taxpayers.

 To sum up, in order to encourage the consumption and boost the growth of economy, it is imperative to increase the disposable income in the hands of individual taxpayers. The increase in the limit of standard deduction could be one of the key initiatives of the government to give some relief to the salaried class taxpayers and simultaneously manage the fiscal deficit.

 SHARE, SAVE, COMMENT

 With Coronavirus cases being reported in different countries like US, Nepal and France, Indian authorities are stepping up their preparedness to prevent the spreading of the contagious virus.

 Delhis prominent hospitals - Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital, along with AIIMS - and hospitals in Mumbai, Cochin, Amritsar etc. have all set up isolation wards to quarantine suspected cases of coronavirus.

 Ministry of Civil Aviation has identified 7 airports including Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Cochin where screening centres have been set up.

 Airports already have a public health emergency contingency plan in place. This kicks in once the World Health Organisation declares a Public Health Emergency of International Concern or in cases where a global epidemic is likely. Some of the points are:

 Airport staff coming in contact with passengers prior to screening will need to wear face masks and take prophylaxis (preventative healthcare)

 During the time of health examination, the staff must wear N92/N95 masks or three layer masks-

 In case of the coronavirus 2019, where India has issued a travel advisory asking visitors to not visit China unless necessary, there have also been entry thermal screenings.

 Airports like Delhi, Mumbai, etc. have health counters which are located before Immigration and the passengers are required to report to it. They also need to present the health card (asking questions pertaining to the disease or travel to affected country) to the doctor and undergo thermal screening.

 Only by passing through the thermal screening can they be cleared for immigration.

 If, for some reason, the passenger is suspected to be a patient, then the passenger is examined in detail by the APHO doctor (Airport Health Organisation)

 First, the suspected patient is sent to the isolation chamber, which is located adjacent to the immigration/ Health counters.

 If found to be suffering from the disease/ exhibiting symptoms, they are referred to a quarantine hospital.

 The patients are transferred to isolation facilities in special ambulances that have also been quarantined.

 Isolation Wards At Hospitals

 Isolation wards have been set up at the Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi.

 Meanwhile, in Mumbai, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has set up an isolation ward at the Kasturba hospital in Chinchpokli, South Mumbai.

 Doctors at the Mumbai Airport have also been been asked to direct returning passengers from China to the isolation unit, if they show symptoms of the Wuhan coronavirus.

 First things first, isolation wards dont mean jails or solitary confinement. Its a space created within a hospital/airport to ensure that infection does not pass down to the other person or the health care worker assisting the patient.

 Checklist of an Isolation Ward

 According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, heres a brief checklist of what an isolation ward at a hospital is supposed to look like

 A container to collect infectious waste, which eventually, is burned

 Adequate supplies with a 1:10 bleach solution to disinfect patient excreta

 A plastic sheet to cover the mattress on which the patient sleeps

 A puncture-resistant container for collecting non usable needles and syringes used on the patient

 Important Pointers to Remember for Healthcare Workers

 Thoroughly wash hands after touching the bodily fluids of the patient, even though gloves have been worn.

 Wear a mask (three layered surgical mask / N 95respirator) and a gown to prevent the spreading of infection while doing patient care.

 Limit the movement of the patient as much as possible, and make them wear a mask if they step out of the designated area.

 Have an alcohol-based disinfectant near the patients room.

 Post signs outside the room that clearly earmark it as an isolation facility.

 Restrict equipment like stethoscopes, thermometer and blood pressure cuff to the infected patient.

 But from a leaked page of John Boltons upcoming book, it seems the president told his top aide that aid to Ukraine will be withheld. This has increased pressure on Republican senators to give in to the demand for new witnesses, especially since Bolton had expressed his desire to testify, given how the Democrats need only 4 Republicans to join them for a bipartisan majority. Republican senators Mitt Romney and Susan Collins said the leaked excerpts highlight the necessity of witness testimony from individuals such as John Bolton.

 Trumps team largely avoided the Bolton issue on the floor of the Senate, stating that there was nothing new in the former NSAs leaked accounts. The possibility of Trumps team trying to prevent Bolton from testifying and also discrediting his public comments is plausible. Trumps lawyer Rudy Giuliani was called a human hand grenade in the Ukraine scandal by former National Security Advisor John Bolton.

 These claims were dismissed by Jane Raskin, Donald Trumps impeachment attorney who called Giuliani a colourful distraction, a household name, a legendary federal prosecutor who took down the mafia, corrupt public officials, wall street racketeers. Crime busting mayor, who cleaned up new york and turned it around. A national hero. Americas mayor after 9/11. And after that, an internationally recognized expert on fighting corruption.

 Joe Bidens son, Hunter Biden also received a lot of hostility from the Presidents team, who said that Hunters decision to join a Ukraine-based company had raised many eyebrows. Pam Bondi, an attorney on Trumps legal team said that Hunter Bidens decision to join Burma raised flags almost immediately. One article from may 2014 stated the appointment of Joe Bidens son to the board of Ukrainian gas firm Burisma has raised eyebrows the world over. Even an outlet with a bias for Democrats pointed out Hunter Bidens activities created a conflict of interest for Joe Biden. The article stated the move raises questions about a potential conflict of interest for Joe Biden.

 But this leak could not have come at a better time for the Democrats, as it helps them to push their case for including new testimonies in the trial. So far the Senate Republicans have rejected this orthodox approach along partisan lines. I certainly hope so. There seems to be a real shift in where the Republican senators are, and I think its very hard for them to maintain that they wanted a fair trial. Wanted to know all the facts when theres a witness who said, Im ready, Ive got something to say. We have an outline of what he has to say. Its really hard to say were not going to hear that, said Adam Schiff, lead House Impeachment Manager.

 The 2020 decade will likely be an age of ‘democracy in trouble’ across major parts of South Asia. Greater oppression, dictatorial policies, and leadership, one-party domination – the challenges are immense. In Pakistan’s case, the long-ailing democracy under the Imran Khan government is now dead. The country, in the aftermath of General Qamar Javed Bajwa’s tenure extension, signals a total reverse of American political scientist Francis Fukuyama’s ‘End of History’ thesis.

 In the early 1990s, after the end of the Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Fukuyama had predicted a phase of human history in which liberal democracy and economic liberalism will be the only flag flying throughout the world. Notwithstanding the growth of neo-liberalism, politically, the opposite happened in Fukuyama’s own country and other large democracies like India. But in countries struggling to find their way to democracy, it’s been a disaster.

 Currently, the weaknesses of the political party system in Pakistan stands exposed with such finality that it’s no more possible for the civil society, including the liberal elements, to deny that the answer to their woes of fighting a military-dominated socio-political system does not lay with the present parties.

 The weakness has permeated through the society that now finds itself in an abyss – no inspiration from outside and little movement within. While India is no more a mental stimulant as it used to be, domestically, the Pakistani military has neutralised almost all segments of the formal civil society. The media and the NGO sectors have turned hopeless. Some elements of the media that seem alive owe their existence (besides their bravery) to the Pakistan Army’s General Headquarters (GHQ), which allows some of them to speak so that a case could be made abroad, as General Bajwa did recently in the UK, that there is no censorship in Pakistan. Things have come to the stage that it is difficult to differentiate between genuine cases of political activism versus intelligence moles.

 If Pakistan’s civilian side appears to have given up on acquiring any control whatsoever, then credit the political fraternity. This includes the Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), whose leader Imran Khan waited 20 years to come to power without having to show any plans for governance. The party’s senior leaders, both Prime Minister Khan and Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, cannot possibly acquire the gumption to object when they are not even allowed to meet senior US leaders and security officials without military officers at their toes.

 Sadly, PTI’s opposition is no different. Besides the smaller regional parties, the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and the Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) have also demonstrated a near-total lack of political depth. The manner in which the PML-N abandoned its social media activists tortured by Pakistan’s intelligence agencies shows they were always going to succumb to any pressure. Similarly, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari’s grand pro-democracy statements do not translate into concrete action in the province of Sindh, which his party controls, because of corruption, nepotism, and poor management.

 Democracy in Pakistan was sick since the country’s birth. From minor to major, all political parties in Pakistan were either created with the military’s help or are infested with their moles. Those with no links to the Pakistani military cannot grow beyond a point. Selected civilians are as much a part of the military fraternity as the men in uniform.

 The top leadership of all political parties has willingly turned their organisations into patronage platforms, negotiating resources from the Pakistani establishment on the one hand, and supporting kleptocratic redistribution of the country’s resources on the other. Thus, political parties have become profitable ventures that remain tightly tied to the top leadership’s apron strings, or those of their progeny, with little desire to develop a multi-layered, class-conscious leadership. There is not a single political party in Pakistan today that has invested in generating its own narrative, given rise to a new generation of workers and student leaders, or established strategic forums that lend a voice to common citizens. These qualities are not something that the Pakistani military stopped them from acquiring; the country’s political parties just never thought or acted this way.

 As for civil-military relations, a lot of attention went into ill-thought-out, temporary ways to push back the military instead of permanently unseating it from the position of power by investing in long-term structural formulas such as civilianising the Ministry of Defence or empowering it and the Defence Committee of Cabinet (now called Cabinet Committee on National Security). Ultimately, democracy proved to be the biggest revenge as Pakistan’s political leadership became increasingly irrelevant in strengthening democracy.

 Sadly, in Pakistan, oppression has become the new normal. Members of the media don’t actively take a principled position against their own for the rights of those who are not paid or are unjustly fired from the job. There is always someone to replace the other as it happens in soulless, power-hungry social systems. Societies capsize for very long durations after demise of politics. Stopping a Lahore-based university from holding a discussion on Baluchistan followed by killing of a social and political activist, Sabeen Mehmud in Karachi soon after she organized a discussion on the subject instilled silence on Balochistan or its disappeared men and women.

 The military decides who can live in Pakistan and who cannot. Those it can afford to silence easily are made to disappear forever. Some return so emotionally mutilated that they would rather be dead. The struggle to control voices is a historic problem in Pakistan, aimed at generating a monotonous, established national narrative that everyone follows without question. In the past, many dissident academics worked from the comfort of foreign lands and could occasionally visit home or return after a regime change.

 But now, many worthwhile dissident voices are actively stopped from returning due to threats to their lives. To those compiling files on dissidents, the alternative argument does not make sense. Nor do they understand why people want to come back, especially from the West. A big part of the oppression is to popularise the narrative that those who disagree with the deep state do not belong in Pakistan. It is assumed that any discussion of the country while sitting outside or desire to return is driven by ill will. There is an intertwining of oppressive power and class divide. The intelligence bureaucrat, whose notes make up the bulk of the content in the file on a dissident, comes from a socioeconomic class that, given a chance, would have gone abroad and never returned. Thus, this bureaucrat is unable to see ‘living abroad’ as anything beyond a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, or is unable to appreciate that people do return to or visit the homeland out of desire and without any malice.

 It’s this mindset that former President Pervez Musharraf stuck to, despite his upward socioeconomic mobility. He believed that ‘Pakistani women get raped to get rich or obtain western visas’.

 The brave and organic leadership of the Pashtun Tahafuz Movement (PTM) as well as the movement itself provides a ray of hope. As long as it can protect itself from the establishment’s penetration that most socio-political structures suffer from, remains a genuine movement with honest leadership at all levels, and doesn’t turn into a patronage-based party structure, the PTM will continue to inspire.

 Although, the real difference will come when the PTM model is replicated in Punjab, which is the bulk of Pakistan and the heart of power. It doesn’t seem likely that the traditional parties have the capacity to inject fresh thought in the heartland of Pakistan. At best, they watch for signs of removal of the PTI government, which may or may not happen. In a situation where Pakistan is no more in the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force as a result of negotiations with the US, the Imran Khan government’s life could get prolonged. In fact, one should not wish for the PTI’s removal because its replacement will be one of the existing opposition parties, which will only prolong Pakistanis’ pain. A real change will only come when the cost of myopic politics increases for all stakeholders, to an extent that everyone agrees to withdraw to mutually agreed-upon lines.

 Dhoni had been on a break after the Indian cricket team lost the World Cup 2019 semi-final match against New Zealand.

1956,0,Hindi,pqr,"Coronavirus is a term used for a group of viruses which are mainly found in animals. Human coronavirus is a type of zoonotic disease in which the infection spreads from animals to humans. There are around six coronaviruses identified by scientists to date that affect human beings and cause mild to severe symptoms. However, the recent coronavirus spread in China has not been identified yet. [2]

 The first case of Human coronavirus was found in the year 1960 in a patient suffering from a common cold. The name ‘corona was given to the virus based on its crown-shaped when viewed from an electron microscope. Such viruses are often harmless and may cause mild respiratory tract infection, especially during the winter season. People often get infected with coronavirus at some point in their lives, get recovered and may get the infection again after a few months.

 The six types of coronavirus infecting humans are alpha coronavirus (NL63 and 229E), beta coronavirus (HKU1 and OC43). The remaining two SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) are known for its life-threatening symptoms.

 Human coronavirus often affects the respiratory tract of a person. The infected fluid in the tract gets transmitted to other people during coughing or sneezing. Also, if the infected person sneezes or coughs in the open air without covering their mouth, the virus spreads in the air through the dispersed droplets. [3]

 The other reasons for the spread of the virus are shanking hands with the infected person, touching the infected object/surface accompanied by touching the nose or mouth simultaneously and touching the patients excreta in rare cases.

 NL63 and 229E, HKU1 and OC43 cause flu-like symptoms which range from mild to moderate. On the other hand, MERS and SARS cause severe symptoms. The symptoms of the prior are as follows: [4]

 People with a weak immune system or who are older have a higher chance of getting infected by the virus and getting serious illnesses like pneumonia or respiratory tract disorder. The symptoms of MERS and SARS are deadly as they are known to cause severe respiratory problems along with kidney failure, diarrhoea and death of a person.

 Human coronavirus is diagnosed by certain laboratory tests which are as follows: [5]

 The exact treatment for human coronavirus has not been discovered yet. Several vaccines to aid the conditions are still under development. However, there are many supportive treatment methods and over-the-counter medicines which can treat its mild-to-moderate symptoms. For example, medicines to treat pain and fever or hot showers to treat sore throat. [6]

1957,0,Hindi,xyz,"Garlic is known for its antibiotic, antiviral and antibacterial properties and helps to inhibit mucous, eliminate mucous from tubes of bronchitis and thus helps to ease the respiratory problem. Also, it helps in relieving the pain as well [3].

 How to: Take a few garlic cloves, crush it. Add about half a teaspoon of ghee in the pan, heat it and then add the crushed garlic cloves. Roast it for a few seconds and eat when hot.

 Known for its anti-inflammatory properties, ginger helps to break down the mucus, making it easier for your body to expel air. It also helps improve circulation to the lungs and reduces inflammation [4].

 How to: Take an inch of ginger root, peel it, chop it into pieces and then boil it. Strain it and drink it in the form of tea for relief.

 The curcumin contained in turmeric is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It helps to fight oxidative stress and reduce airway inflammation [5].

 How to: Turmeric can be added to the food regularly. Or heat a teaspoon of ghee, then turn off the heat. Add a teaspoon of turmeric and then mix it well. Have this along with a cup of lukewarm milk.

 Eucalyptus oil may help with opening airways in COPD as well as treating inflammation. This helps in improving the breathing and reduce the symptoms [6].

 How to: Put a few drops of eucalyptus oil in hot water and then inhale the steam.

 Note: However, breathing in concentrated eucalyptus oil can cause lung irritation and make symptoms worse.

 Adding foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids helps in fighting the symptoms of COPD. Walnuts, almonds, flaxseeds, avocados and olive oil are a few foods that are rich in omega-3 fats and helps fight COPD [7].

 Apart from following the aforementioned remedies, one must also consider the following steps.

 Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are two diseases that contribute to the development of COPD in a person. The first vital step that a person must take to prevent COPD is to quit smoking. One can try for nicotine replacement products like patches, gums, and lozenges, which will help keep the habit at bay [8].

 Shortness of breath, which is one symptom of COPD, can be managed with the help of regular exercises, which can help build endurance. It is normally advisable to do gentle exercises like slow walking, gardening and golfing. Breathing exercises can also help as it strengthens the chest muscles, making breathing easy [9].

 Note: One must seek a doctors recommendation about the type of exercises that can be done.

 A healthy diet is highly essential to control COPD symptoms. Consuming low-fat protein, whole grains, lots of fresh fruits and vegetables and cutting down on salt intake helps in managing the symptoms and providing relief [10].

 This is the easiest thing to do of all the lifestyle changes. A person with COPD must have a minimum of 8 to 10 glasses of water daily. By doing this, the mucus in the lung does not thicken up and stick to the lungs, which happens if an adequate quantity of water is not consumed - staying hydrated makes breathing easier [11].

 Consuming carbonated drinks swells up the stomach and puts pressure on the diaphragm. This makes breathing harder. So, steer clear of soda if youre suffering from COPD [12].

 Regular drinking habit worsens the effects of COPD, a study says. Two things happen with the intake of alcohol - one, it reduces glutathione level which protects the lungs from smoke and, two, the airway becomes unhealthy with mucus and other contaminants [13].

 A normal BMI is essential to handle the effects of COPD in a better way. The lungs and heart of a person with COPD work harder than those of an ordinary person to help the body breathe. With weight gain, the work of the lungs and the heart only double up, thereby exerting excessive pressure on the respiratory system [14].

 An individual suffering from COPD should be wary of the symptoms as theres no cure for COPD and no way to repair the damage to airways and lungs [15]. Apart from the aforementioned, you can help yourself by staying away from pollutants, keeping your house free from dampness and also by maintaining personal hygiene.

 Planning

 Owning a loan for a long time is not a good idea as the borrower will end up repaying higher amount than whatever the principal amount he or she had borrowed, thanks to the higher interest rates which makes the total repayment amount more costlier for the borrower.

 Planning and executing the plan plays a very important role to clear off debts. Irrespective of the amount of debt, everyone has to manage their debt in one or the other way to pay it off quickly by keeping up with your payments and making sure that it does not get out of control. If in case, you have a large amount of debt, then you will have to put in some more extra effort to pay off your loan amidst juggling between payments on the debts which you are not currently paying.

 Most of the people will be looking out for ways to pay off their loan amount in one or the other way. A few of the options as to how debt can be cleared off quickly is listed below, take a look at it.

 What is a Debt?

 The term debt is a financial word used for the amount of money borrowed by one party (borrower) from another (lender). Debt is also known as loan or mortgages. It is used by many individuals and corporations as a means to make large purchases which otherwise they cannot afford under the prevailing normal circumstances. The debt arrangement involves the permission to the borrower to borrow money under a preset condition that it has to be paid back along with interest at a later date.

 With the household debt in India rising at an alarming rate, one has to look out for ways to reduce the debt which will help the borrower to come out of the vicious cycle of the debt trap. The rising household debt has touched around $300 billion in 2018 compared to $120 billion, a decade ago in 2008.

 Though the rising household debt has boosted the consumption currently, in the long - run, it will harm the economic growth of the country.

 Lets explore the ways which help to clear off debts quickly.

 Making prompt monthly payments will help to save oneself from late penalty fees and higher interest rates. If in case, you do not have enough money to pay the complete bill amount at least ensure, that you make minimum payments on time. This trick holds good especially for credit cards wherein the interest rate charged on the cards is as high as 2.5% or even more monthly and in some cases, the annual interest rates on credit cards even touch 40% or so.

 Gather all the data on the bill statements be it for loans, credit cards. Check your loan statements and check for accuracy, identify all the recorded entries carefully and find out the outstanding loan amount which is yet to be repaid. Now fix a time frame within which you are planning to pay off the loan.

 As you will be aware of your take-home pay, you will have to include all the items of expenses including, grocery, medical bills, utility bills, childrens education fee and so on before deciding on if you can pay more than the existing equated monthly instalment (EMIs) or earn more money to repay debt early.

 Some of the banks in India offer loans at an attractive interest rate compared to others and hence transferring the loan from the bank which offers higher interest rates to the one which charges a lower rate of interest will also help the borrower to repay the loan much earlier.

 For Example: If a salaried individual has taken a personal loan of Rs 1,00,000 from Axis Bank which charges an interest rate in the range of 12% - 24% per annum compared to SBI which offers interest rates ranging between 11.50% - 13.50% per annum. It is better to transfer the loan from Axis Bank to SBI as the interest rate on loan amount will come down as so is the total loan repayment amount by the borrower.

 All most every individual will be aware of an emergency fund. It is advised for the borrowers to build an emergency fund with a part of their income before they begin to pay off their debts as this fund will come in handy to meet any kind of unexpected bills or expenses which could pop up in future. Some of the investors indicate that the emergency funds should be equal to at least 6 times your monthly net salary amount.

 Listing out of all the bills beginning from smallest to largest gives you a clarity of the interest rates charged on them. After listing, classify them accordingly based their interest rates and in the order starting from highest interest rates and move towards listing out the one which carries lower interest rates. It is advised to pay off the debts which have the highest interest rates first as this will help you to reduce the loan amount in the future. Also look out for tax benefits, if it is a home loan. The home loans in India comes up with a tax exemption of up to Rs 2,50,000 per annum on the interest paid amount.

 Having a budget helps individuals to ensure that they have enough money to cover for the full months expense. Plan far enough in advance and you can take the required action at the earliest if the situation looks like you will not have sufficient money to pay for your coming months bills. Preparing a pre-planned budget helps you to minimize your unwanted expenses which in turn will build extra money and the same can be utilized to pay off debt faster. It is very important to stick to your budgeted plan to achieved your goal to clear off loans at the earliest.

 Another way to quickly pay the debt is to earn more money. One can work for extra hours and earn a part-time job in addition to the existing one or can search for a better job which pays you better. By increasing the income, one can pay off loans and clear it within a short duration. There are many ways to earn a decent part-time income along with your regular job.

 By Michael Powell

 It was late at night in January 2015. The Los Angeles Lakers had lost a game to the Cleveland Cavaliers and the media relations people in Los Angeles said in a whisper that their temperamental star would soon hold court.

 Twenty minutes later, as the clock neared midnight, Kobe Bryant strolled into the press room at Staples Center, lithe with those high cheek bones and ferocious eyes. He wore a tailored white shirt and an Italian-cut gray suit with a black satin pocket square.

 He took a seat and peered at the two dozen reporters before him and shrugged. Go ahead. Ask me something.

 Bryant’s sessions with reporters could be combative and obscure — he once compared his urgent, clamorous need to shoot to a city’s fight against crime — but they could also be honest and piercing, and the uncertainty could make performance art of such encounters. This night, midway through his penultimate NBA season, he had dished 17 artful, darting assists, part of his career-twilight incarnation as a point guard.

 Did you, a reporter asked, ever think you’d have this many assists?

 Bryant peered at the reporter and nodded.

 “Yes, honestly,” he said. “Yes, I did.”

 What about the applause you get now on the road and all the opposing players who embrace you? What do you make of that? Bryant leaned forward and nodded, self-aware enough to concede that opponent love weirded him out.

 “This is different for me, man. I’m used to being hated. This is really unnatural.”

 Bryant was a confounding and intriguing star, complicated and intelligent and self-aware and nasty, and accepting of all of that in himself. He came upon the NBA scene as a preternaturally composed 18-year-old, a man-child fluent in Italian who could dart downcourt putting the ball once, twice, three times between his legs and then launch a fallaway 3-pointer.

 He embraced competitive rage as an elixir, to the point where you wondered if it might drive him mad. He reveled in his nickname, Black Mamba, that most venomous of Africa’s snakes. In games, in mid-flow, his eyes would narrow to slits as he coiled and spun one way and another and another and his wrists flicked that deadly fall-away jumper. As he backpedaled downcourt, he liked to lean into his hapless defender and detail precisely how and why that man should feel humiliated.

 Once, in middle school, Bryant recalled, he destroyed the ego of an opponent and ever after ached for more.

 “That feeling of playing with that rage was new to me, but I loved it,” he said in a Showtime documentary.

 The great Boston Celtics forward Paul Pierce, no slouch when it came to abasing opponents, noted that Bryant’s genius as an offensive player was that he exhausted you before he exhausted his supremely conditioned self.

 All that is gone. Bryant’s career ended four years ago and now a helicopter crash has claimed not only the life of that still-young force of nature but of eight others, including his lovely 13-year-old daughter, Gianna. That is a horror beyond words for any father and mother.

 There is, if we’re honest, more to reckon with here, a darker chapter of Bryant’s celebrity, especially a young woman’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her and sidestepped any legal consequence. That 2003 accusation was nearly washed away at the time in an unsightly river of salacious reporting and counterclaims about the woman. Relatively few in the news media or basketball did themselves proud, and you are left to wonder if Bryant would have survived in a #MeToo age of awareness.

 The evidence, incomplete though it might be, long struck me as deeply troubling, and so I’m left trying to take account of this man, this star, without sidestepping it myself. Perhaps the eventual subsiding of grief and loss will allow us to take a clearer measure of Bryant. For now, we’re left with the memory of his ravenous will and intelligence, and his rage against the dying of his athletic light. And to wonder if a softer, more chastened Bryant had emerged.

 The 2014-15 season, his second to last, came as his body ran upon the shoals, with a blown knee, fractures and a torn Achilles tendon. He battled back with attitudinal fury. His coach, Byron Scott, predicted — foolishly — that Bryant would play all 82 games that year; Bryant didn’t disagree. (His body allowed him to play only 35.) He screamed at his teammate Jeremy Lin. He walked out of a practice, calling his teammates “soft like Charmin,” a critique larded with a splendid helping of obscenities.

 And he shot, and shot again. He averaged just over 22 points a game that season even as his shooting percentage plummeted to 37%. On too many nights, his rage to dominate seemed to deprive him of his basketball senses. Even the greatest athletes find that mortality shoves, rather than tiptoes, into their room.

 His redeeming grace, on display that January night, was that he was never less than cleareyed about what was happening to him. So when a reporter asked Bryant if he remembered what it was like as a young lion to face an old star like him, he shook his head. Know thyself.

 “For me, it was always about chasing the wounded gazelle,” he said.

 Talk turned to his opponent that night: LeBron James, then with the Cavaliers. As Bryant had spent much of his career chasing the legend of Michael Jordan, so James had spent years chasing after Bryant’s crown. Respect in such rivalries was most often expressed with snarls and Darwinian thrusts, and never more so than with Bryant.

 This night, however, Bryant sat back in his chair, his jawline soft, and talked of something like friendship with James. The men had exchanged hand slaps and a smile during the game.

 “When we were competing for championships, it was a little different, a lot more moody,” Bryant said.

 He shook his head, as if to make sense of a strange thought. “We seem to have become friends.”

 On Saturday, the night before he boarded that helicopter, Bryant watched James hit a driving layup and pass him on the NBA’s career scoring list. And Bryant, who in recent years seemed excited to discover that his retirement had given him a second life of possibility, wrote a tweet of genuine respect:

 “Continuing to move the game forward,” he wrote, tagging James’ account. “Much respect my brother.”

 It was the last public gesture Bryant would make in a life foreshortened.

 Dom Sibley, Dom Bess and Zak Crawley will join up with the England Lions squad for the red-ball leg of their tour of Australia after impressing with the senior team in South Africa, the England and Wales Cricket Board said on Monday.

 England sealed a 191-run win in the fourth test against South Africa at The Wanderers to complete a 3-1 series victory.

 The trio were already named in the original Lions squad last month, but their fitness levels were monitored in recent weeks as their playing time increased with the senior team.

 Sibley scored his maiden hundred in Cape Town and finished with series with 324 runs at an average of 54, while Crawley celebrated his first test half-century in the final test.

 In the absence of Jack Leach, off-spinner Bess claimed his first test five-wicket haul in Port Elizabeth.

 “It has been great to see them performing so well in the test arena and the Lions tour is an opportunity for them to continue their development in international cricket, gaining experience in a wider range of conditions,” ECB performance director Mo Bobat said.

 “This will not only allow them to hone their skills on Australian wickets for future Ashes series, but is also a chance to continue their form with selection for England’s Sri Lanka tour on the horizon.”

 Lions will play three four-day matches in Australia, starting against Cricket Australia XI in Hobart from Feb. 15-18.

 South Africa face testing time but skipper sees some light

 Captain Faf du Plessis said South Africa face an uphill task to re-establish themselves as a top test team but predicted they would bounce back in a few years after losing the series to England on Monday.

 South Africa were handed an eighth defeat in their last nine tests — their worst run in over 100 years — as England completed a 3-1 series win by beating their hosts by 191 runs in the fourth test at The Wanderers on Monday.

 Du Plessis blamed the team’s plight on the loss of many key players in recent years, including AB de Villers, Hashim Amla, Morne Morkel and Dale Steyn, and now Vernon Philander, who played his last test on Monday.

 “We’ve got some good things in place with a strong and experienced coaching team and we know that in time they will guide players but the experience we are lacking now will also take time to get,” he said.

 South African cricket, reeling from accusations of corruption in its administration, appointed former wicketkeeper Mark Boucher as coach less than a fortnight before the series against England started and called up several untested players.

 “We’ve had nine debutants in the last eight tests, which just shows where we are. It’s experience we need and it will take time, and I know everyone is disappointed but every team goes through this.

 “Unfortunately we are at the stage where it is happening right now and I have no doubt that in a year or two, we’ll look back at this time and see that this is where it started again for us.”

 Du Plessis said the new test bowlers needed time to improve but praised the performance of Anrich Nortje, who proved a rare highlight for South Africa over the four tests against England.

 “There is a gap where our next tier of bowlers need to be, to get to same quality as (Kagiso) Rabada, Philander, Morkel and Steyn.

 “Nortje had a really good series and he is one of the finds for us. We always knew he had pace but the fact he showed control and adapted with different lengths on different pitches is what we need.

 “We need guys to come into test cricket and just shine. That’s what used to happen and it eased the transition period a lot quicker.”

 There was an expectation that the 35-year-old Du Plessis might step down after Monday’s loss but he said he would not be making any hasty decisions.

The ministry is not just working to boost different cultures and languages within the nation, but also supports the hospitality industry, local vendors, upkeep of historic sites and much more.

 Keeping the view in mind, the Centre has decided to reward those travellers who visit 15 different domestic tourist spots in a year. According to Minister of Tourism Prahlad Singh Patel, the government will sponsor their travel expenses as an incentive. The minister made the announcement at the concluding ceremony of the two-day National Tourism Conference organised by the Odisha government in association with FICCI at Konark.

 It won’t be a cash prize, since the Union Minister has clearly mentioned that the move is purely an incentive. He said, “The Tourism Ministry will fund the travel expenses of tourists who visit 15 destinations in the country in a year and submit the photos to our website. However, the condition is that the person should travel out of his/her own state to be eligible for contention. We should honour these persons as brand ambassadors of Indian Tourism.”

 The Ministry of Tourism has also been organising certificate programmes for candidates intending to work as tourist guides, opening up an opportunity for employment for people of all backgrounds.

 “It feels amazing. Every artist waits for an honour like this and it feels great to have received it. I was waiting for this honour since a long time. I thought I would perhaps have to wait for the award this year as well but I finally received it,” Suresh Wadkar told IANS.

 “I don’t know what their criteria is because many people who are my junior have received it at least 10 to 12 years ago. I have spent so many years in this industry. It has been 45 years. Don’t you think seniors should get it before the juniors? But I am grateful to this government for conferring me with this honour. I’d have been happier had I got it on time,” he added.

 The Padma Shri awardee has been a prominent voice in Bollywood’s music scene apart from various regional film industries. He has lent his voice to numerous hits of the eighties, nineties and the 2000s. His songs in Ram Teri Ganga Maili, Gaman, Sadma, Parinda, Utsav, Chandni, Masoom, and Maachis continue to be fondly remembered by melody lovers.

 However, Wadkar feels he does not fit the bill for present-day composers in Bollywood.

 “Times are changing. New singers and composers have come in. The way they think, maybe I don’t fit in that. I don’t think there can be any other valid reason regarding why am I not offered work in Bollywood anymore”, he said sounding a little hurt.

 The 64-year-old singer also commented on Bollywood’s contemporary music and questioned its longevity.

 “There is a deep western influence in Bollywood’s music now. I don’t see Indian music being created in the industry these days. Youngsters these days are still singing 40-year-old songs to prove their talent. This shows the importance of Indian music. If today’s songs have that power, they should survive 50 years later too, just like yesteryear’s music survives even today. But will that happen?” Wadkar signs off with uncertainty in his voice.

 Days after a picture of former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah created buzz on social media, the BJP unit of Tamil Nadu said it was “disheartened” to see his bearded photo and sent the National Conference leader a pack of razors.

 In a tweet, the party said, “Dear @OmarAbdullah, It’s very disheartening to see you like this while most of your corrupt friends are enjoying life outside. Kindly accept our sincere contribution, in case of any assistance feel free to contact ur counterpart @INCIndia for further help in this regard.” The tweet also included a  screenshot of the order, addressed to Srinagar.

 On January 25, a picture of Omar Abdullah sporting a greyish-white long beard emerged on social media. It showed him smiling in a snow-covered jacket and sporting an unkempt greyish beard.

 The tweet comes after the Congress dispatched a copy of the Indian Constitution to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a “gift” on Republic Day. “Dear PM, the Constitution is reaching you soon. When you get time off from dividing the country, please do read it. Regards, Congress,” the tweet read.

 Abdullah, along with two other former chief ministers – his father Farooq Abdullah and Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti – are in detention since August last year after the Centre revoked provisions of Article 370.

 Earlier on Monday, BJP leader Giriraj Singh took a jibe at the picture and questioned if article 370 was removed from the valley or was it the razor?

 West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee also shared the picture calling it ‘unfortunate.“I could not recognize Omar in this picture. I am feeling sad.

1981,0,Gujarati,abc,"New Delhi : Delhi Police have launched a massive manhunt to nab controversial JNU student Sharjeel Imam, booked on sedition charges for his alleged inflammatory speeches during anti-CAA protests.

 A top Delhi Police officer told IANS on Monday that the police feared that Sharjeel Imam has fled to Nepal. “If he has sneaked into Nepal, then it will be very difficult to bring him to India,” the police said.

 Delhi Police teams conducted multiple raids in Mumbai, Delhi and Patna in search of Imam but so far he has been elusive.

 “Sharjeel Imam was last seen in Bihar’s Phulwarisharif between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. on January 25. He has disappeared since then,” the officer also claimed.

 According to a source in Delhi Police, Imam practically disappeared from between their fingers. “Our teams were waiting for the right time to nab him. We had our eyes on him, but in the meantime, he disappeared.”

 Delhi Police, however, on Tuesday claimed that Imam will soon be nabbed.

 Delhi Police spokesperson told IANS on Tuesday, “Soon he will be arrested. We have been raiding the possible hideouts where he could be. Five teams have been formed. They conducted raids in Maharashtra, Delhi and Bihar. We are questioning his kin also to get an idea about his whereabouts.”

 In a video that went viral on January 25, Imam was seen talking about splitting the northeast from India to block the implementation of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). “We know how Muslims are being treated in Assam. We have to save people from the NRC. The only way to do this is by cutting off northeast from India.”

 The Crime Branch of the Delhi Police registered a case against Imam for the provocative video on Republic Day.

 Twenty seven-year-old Martin Logma was arrested on Monday and produced before a local court in Chakradharpur, which sent him to 14-days judicial custody, an official release said.

 The other 15 accused, aged between 19 and 60 years, were arrested on Sunday and charged with murder and rioting, among others, it said.

 They were produced before the court of sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Chakradharpur on Monday which sent them to 14-days judicial custody, the release said.

 Supporters of ‘Pathalgarhi’ movement had allegedly kidnapped the seven villagers of Burugulikera in Guddi block on January 21 and killed them for allegedly opposing their stir. Their mutilated bodies were recovered from a forest, around 4 kilometres from the village the next day.

 Proponents of ‘Pathalgarhi’, a tribal movement, want that no laws of the land should apply to the tribal people.

 They write tenets on large stones and erect them in their areas of influence.

 The killings that took place days after the JMM- Congress-RJD coalition government assumed power in the state on December 29, triggered widespread outrage and Chief Minister Hemant Soren ordered an investigation by a special investigation team (SIT).

 Kochi, Jan 28: A gay couple has moved the Kerala High Court, seeking to strike down certain provisions under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, which do not permit to get their marriage registered.

 Considering the writ petition by the petitioners on Monday, the court has sought the views of Central and state governments on the matter. The petitioners, a business man and an IT professional had met each other in May 2018 and fallen in love. After being in a relationship for two months, they decided to get hitched.

 In September last year, they got married in a private ceremony. However, the religious authorities declined to solemnise the wedding and hence the couple decided to get their marriage registered under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, which does not recognise homosexual marriages.

 SC legalises gay sex, partially strikes down Sec 377

 In their plea, the gay couple stated that it was aggrieved by the provisions of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 whereby the law provided therein only permits a heterosexual (opposite sex) couple to get married and a homosexual couple like them is denied equal access to the institution of marriage. They claim that the impugned provisions of the Act violate their fundamental rights and are thus illegal and unconstitutional to that extent.

 Seeking declarations in this connection and to obtain the relief for getting married under the Act, the writ petition was being moved jointly by the petitioners, who submitted that they have suffered public humiliation after they disclosed their love for each other. But, greater is the insult and indignity the petitioners have suffered at the hands of law, which refuses to recognise their union, causing immense pain and agony to them, they said in the petition.

 No gay pride as yet: Why the SC ruling on Section 377 is not yet applicable to J&K

 Noting that the impugned provisions restrict the process of application, solemnisation and registration of marriages to heterosexual couples alone and exclude homosexual couples from its ambit, thepetitioners said it must be held unconstitutional and thus be struck or read down to that extent of illegality.

 New Delhi, Jan 28: The Supreme Court has allowed the introduction of African Cheetahs in India.

 In August the Supreme Court said that it was not against the ambitious project to relocate African Cheetah from Namibia to Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh.

 There were no recorded evidence of Tiger-Cheetah conflicts, it said and sought a view of lawyer assisting the court on relocation of the animals.

 Convicts in post Godhra riots case granted bail: SC directs them to carry out spiritual, social work

 A bench of Justices S A Bobde and B R Gavai wondered as how the court would know whether the Cheetah would survive after senior advocate Wasim Qadri, appearing for National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA), said the sanctuary also has various animals like Tiger and Leopard.

 The top court, however, supported the move of NTCA and said that it was not against the policy to experiment relocating African Cheetah in Madhya Pradesh.

 At the outset, Qadri said that the observation of the Amicus Curiae that the areas in question are not preferred habitat of Cheetah is totally incorrect.

 NTCA said all the potential sites found feasible for reintroducing Cheetah will be reassessed and an action plan will be developed for measures that are required, prior to the reintroduction.

 The authority further said that Madhya Pradesh government has written to it for Cheetah reintroduction at Nauradehi Wildlife Sanctuary.

 On February 22, NTCA had told the apex court that the African cheetahs, to be translocated in India from Namibia, will be kept at Nauradehi wildlife sanctuary in Madhya Pradesh.

 It said the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which provides inputs to governments and institutions on biodiversity, climate change and sustainable development, has given no objection for the translocation.

 Indias last spotted cheetah had died in 1947. In 1952, the animal was declared extinct in the country.

 Nothing more urgent says CJI on plea by Nirbhayas killer

 NTCA had earlier told the court that it was only seeking a clarification that there is no blanket ban of the apex court on re-introduction of cheetahs in the country.

 It informed the court that IUCN has said it would co-operate with India in translocation of Cheetahs from Namibia.

 It also referred to the apex courts 2013 decision in a wildlife case and said it does not prevent the authorities from taking steps in conformity with the law to relocated cheetahs from Africa to suitable sites in India.

 Google Street View, a feature of Google Maps and Google Earth, provides interactive panoramic views from many streets in the world. The photography for the tool is done by cars, boats, snowmobiles, underwater apparatus and people on foot.

 Time and again, the tool has produced images that have gone viral on social media. While many of them have actually helped individuals, some have given netizens a good laugh.

 In September 2019, the tool helped in finding the remains of a man who disappeared more than two decades ago in Florida. Twenty-two years after William Moldt went missing, the police received information about a car submerged in a pond in Moon bay Circle, Wellington. The car was spotted on Google Maps by a previous resident of the area.

 Another viral footage from Google Street View showed a man taking a nasty fall on some steps in New York.

 However, the latest image to go viral from Google Street View is one that suggests someone had a good night out. A bit too good, given his position. Sharp-eyed photographers of Google Street View captured a guy lying on the floor behind a car on a street in Île-de-France. The photo, first shared on Reddit, has now been circulated on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

 The man has his hand over his eyes with some leftover beer cans on his side.

 Over the years, Google Street View in Google Maps has captured many unsuspecting people and innocent animals. In one tragic incident, a Google car appeared to hit a hare, sending it flying through the air.

 Google Maps is still one of the most reliable and used applications in the world. It not only keeps a track of your location and destination but also shows distances between two points, the estimated time of arrival and also the traffic conditions prevailing on various roads of a city or town.

1992,0,Hindi,pqr,"The Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) leader Anurag Thakur stoked controversy on Monday at an election rally in Delhi as he is seen in a viral video seen raising slogans, like “Desh ke gaddaro ko” and urging the crowd to complete the slogan with, “goli maaro saalo ko” (Shoot the traitors).

 The Union Minister of State for Finance was campaigning for Manish Chaudhary in the Rithala Assembly seat on Monday.

 In the video Thakur, sporting a grey kurta and saffron stole, can be seen indulging in hate speech, although the model code of conduct is being implemented by the Election Commission due to the Delhi polls. He can be seen raising slogans, like “Desh ke gaddaro ko” and the crowd completing that with, “goli maaro saalo ko” (Shoot the traitors).

 Many BJP members were on the stage with him at that time. Lok Sabha MP Hans Raj Hans is also seen on the stage. Home Minister Amit Shah later came to address the same crowd.

 Responding on the incident, Congress spokesperson Sanjay Jha took to Twitter and questioned  PM Narendra Modi’s silence, “This is serious! Mr Prime Minister @narendramodi : What action will you take against him for openly propagating violence ??? Kindly respond on Twitter.”

 Another Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi tweeted, “Disappointing to see a young leader like AnuragThakur provoking to make such poisonous slogans during electioneering. This seems to be the modus operandi of the entire party.”

 “Mr Narendra Modi: I am awaiting your response, PM Sir. I am assuming if you ignore it , you endorse Anurag Thakur’s speech. Over to you!”

 Mr @narendramodi : I am awaiting your response, PM Sir. I am assuming if you ignore it , you endorse Anurag Thakur’s speech.

 Over to you! #Reminder1 https://t.co/8MwysIMSLr

 — Sanjay Jha (@JhaSanjay) January 28, 2020

 While Shiv Sena’s Priyanka Chaturvedi posted, “When he is done shooting the ‘traitors’, hope the junior Finance Minister of the country will shoot the reasons for the economic slump through the budget. Or will the country will continue to witness a slowdown?”

 Earlier, the BJP candidate from Model Town constituency, Kapil Mishra was banned by the Election Commission on Saturday from campaigning for 48 hrs on January 25.

 The Election Commission’s decision came against Mishra’s controversial statements in which he compared the February 8 Assembly Election as India vs Pakistan contest and referred Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh as “mini-Pakistan”.

 On Thursday, Kapil Mishra, BJP’s Model Town candidate, had in a tweet said that February 8 polls will be a “match between India and Pakistan”.

 He further, in another tweet, went on to describe the Shaheen Bagh protests against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) as “mini Pakistans” being created in Delhi.

 “AAP and Congress have created these mini-Pakistans, like the one in Shaheen Bagh. They will get the answer from India on February 8. Whenever seditious people create a Pakistan in India, they will come face-to-face with patriotic Indians,” Mishra ranted.

 The Delhi Assembly Election will be a triangular fight involving the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress.

 Polling will be held on February 8 and the results declared on February 11.

1996,0,Telugu,abc,"Bharatiya Janata Party MP Parvesh Verma on Tuesday claimed that Delhi voters must think hard about which party they choose in the upcoming election because “lakhs of protestors” gathering in Delhi’s Shaheen Bagh locality to demonstrate against the Citizenship Amendment Act will enter their homes to “rape their sisters and daughters and kill them”, ANI reported.

 “Lakhs of people gather there [Shaheen Bagh],” Verma told ANI. “The people of Delhi will have to carefully and thoughtfully make a decision. These people will enter your homes, they will pick up your sisters and daughters and rape and kill them.”

 Hundreds of women, along with children, have been peacefully protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens at Shaheen Bagh for almost a month and a half. The law has been widely criticised as discriminatory and Indian Muslims fear it could be used with the NRC to harass and disenfranchise them.

 #WATCH: BJP MP Parvesh Verma says, ...Lakhs of people gather there (Shaheen Bagh). People of Delhi will have to think & take a decision. Theyll enter your houses, rape your sisters&daughters, kill them. Theres time today, Modi ji & Amit Shah wont come to save you tomorrow... pic.twitter.com/1G801z5ZbM

 “Arvind Kejriwal says I am with Shaheen Bagh, the Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia says I am with Shaheen Bagh,” Verma added. “The people of Delhi know the fire that once broke out in Kashmir, where the sisters and daughters of Kashmiri Pandits were raped...The same fire broke out in Uttar Pradesh, in Hyderabad, in Kerala, now the same fire has broken out in a corner of Delhi.”

 He continued: “Today there is time. Tomorrow Modi ji won’t come to save you, Amit Shah won’t come to save you. The people of Delhi are safe only till Modi ji is the prime minister of India.”

 Verma’s comments came a day after Union minister Anurag Thakur had encouraged the audience at a rally to shout an incendiary slogan. Thakur, the minister of state for finance, shouted “desh ke gaddaron ko”, and the crowd responded with “goli maaro saalon ko [shoot the traitors to the country]”.

 On Monday, Verma said Shaheen Bagh protests will be cleared in an hour if the BJP won the Delhi Assembly elections, News18 reported. “If the BJP comes to power in Delhi on February 11, we will clear Shaheen Bagh of all protest and protesters within one hour. Not a single person will be visible,” he said, while addressing a crowd at a community centre in Ranhola village, West Delhi.

 The BJP leader added that within one month all the existing mosques built on government land will be demolished.

Rahul and Shreyas Iyer, saying it was great to see the two youngsters coming off age and showing the world that they are match winners.Rahul and Iyer played instrumental roles in the first two T20Is against New Zealand which India won comfortably to take a 2-0 lead in the five-match series.The more opportunities that these guys get, they are showing that they are capable. They are showing that they are match-winners on their day. That will help the team, of course, but it will also help their confidence, Rathour said speaking to reporters on the eve of the third T20I.Having seen KL (Rahul) and Shreyas as young cricketers coming through, in my mind, I have absolutely no doubt that they are match-winners. They are getting their opportunities now and they are showing the world what they are capable of, that is great to see, he said.According to the batting coach, Iyers biggest strength is his positive frame of mind which helps to play in tense situations.Apart from having those (batting) skills, I think the mind set is amazing. He (Iyer) believes he is a big player, and he is, without any doubt. He genuinely believes that he is a match-winner and he is here to stay. And that mindset I think helps him, that is the biggest advantage he has, he said.For the next three games which will be played on bigger grounds in Hamilton, Wellington and Mt. Maunganui as compared to the Eden Park, Rathour said there wont be many changes in terms of their planning and approach and the team would look to continue with the same game plan which saw them win the first two T20Is.You look at the conditions and go. It (Seddon Park) is a bigger ground, it is a regular ground, but we are still looking to play normal cricket, good cricket. I dont think it alters anything. Maybe for the bowlers with their lengths, but with the batters, doesnt make any difference, said Rathour.On bigger grounds (like in Australia), running between wickets will cover the game plan. A good game plan is about players who look at the situation, conditions and accordingly bat. If we play on bigger grounds, I am sure this team is capable of running twos and threes and adjust their game accordingly, he added.The batting coach was also impressed with the young crop of cricketers coming from A tours and contributing to the teams success.A-tour helps a lot. In case of any injuries, if you are looking for any replacements, we know players are here, just a city away. They can immediately come in and they are already acclimatised to the conditions.

There is not that vast a difference now like it used to be earlier.

Even today, some consider adoption, IVF, surrogacy under the sensitive (read taboo) subjects in our nation. And in a place where even talking about it is considered as a taboo, let alone people actually taking a step towards it and making a change in the society. But amidst such medieval thinking, there are some who fought the odds and inspired many, taking a step to bring a change in the society. And Bollywood’s ‘mast mast’ girl, Raveena Tandon had broken the stereotypes, when she had decided to become a single mother in her early twenties.

As shocking it was back then when Raveena had adopted her late cousins two daughters while at the peak of her career, it was inspiring for millions as she became a single mother at the age of 21. Raveena is a mother to four kids- Chaya and Pooja through adoption and two biological children, Ranbirvardhan Thadani and Rasha Thadani through her marriage with Anil Thadani.

Sharing the pictures from the baby shower ceremony, Raveena had written, “Me and my brood! My baby’s baby!

 In a throwback interview, Raveena Tandon had expressed how she found sisters in her foster daughters and had remarked, “I was just 21 years old, when I adopted two girls. But they were like the two sisters I never had. We grew up together. In fact, I told them all the mistakes that I made in my life, so that they wouldn’t make the same in theirs.” Speaking about the challenges she had faced, Raveena had elaborated in a Verve magazine interview, “This was before Mohra (1994). My mother and I used to visit orphanages like Asha Sadan on our weekends. When my cousin passed away he left behind two young daughters, Chaya and Pooja. I didn’t like the way their guardian was treating them so I took them home with me. I didn’t think much of it. It came naturally to me. I wanted to give the girls the life they deserved. I’m not a multibillionaire but I do what I can to help.” (Also Read: Kalki Koechlin Flaunts Her Cute Baby Bump In A Swimsuit, Her Adorable Pregnancy Glow Is Unmissable)

1999,0,English,pqr,"Bengaluru: A 41-year-old woman in Bengaluru had a terrifying ordeal while on her morning when a man walking his dog forced her to touch his genitals. The woman was petting the man’s dog when he unzipped his pants and asked to touch his private parts, the Bangalore Mirror reported.

 The incident happened on Saturday when the woman, an IT professional working at a private firm, was taking a routine stroll around a lake near her residence. The man, who was walking a golden retriever dog, unleashed the canine that playfully ran towards the woman.

 As the woman was busy petting the dog, the man walked up to her, held her hand asking her to be careful and slowly unzipped his pants, forcing the woman to touch his genitals. Shocked by the man’s act, she started screaming, alerting others in the spot.

 As the woman screamed, the man quickly zipped his pants and was walking away from her when he caught him by the collar and clicked a photo of him through her phone. The man managed to flee from the spot and before anyone could intervene or catch hold of him.

 The woman was quoted by the newspaper, saying, This was an extremely horrifying experience and shocking to say the very least. It’s unbelievable that such perverts roam freely and use dogs to target women. While I was petting the dog, he came towards me, held my hand and asked me to be careful, I thought he was warning me off to not pet the dog too close to his mouth. But next thing I know, he takes my hand and puts it’s on his genital area. It happened so quickly, I didnt even have time to react.

 She described the man to be young, between the age of 25 to 30 years, wearing a black hoodie and blue pants. She also told the newspaper that she went to the police station from the spot of the incident and submitted the photo of the man with her complaint to the police. An FIR has been filed under section 354 (intent to outrage the modesty of a woman) under the Indian Penal Code.
